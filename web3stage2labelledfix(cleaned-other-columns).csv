So your original statement says that they dont have to pay shills and bot armies Your most recent statement says that they are using paid shills in the form of talking heads representing corporate owned and paid for media sources Im assuming you generalized what corporate media is doing instead of sticking to the NFT topic I agree with your statement just dont see at first glance how those examples are super relevant to NFTs So youre halfway there They use bots to make the sheeple think they are not alone with their dumbass sentiment that NFTs are bad The media tells sheeple what direction to think The bots legitimize the conclusions and echo sentiment until they effectively radicalize the opinions being spewed by corporate media bots Its their formula,0,1,1,0,0
People who profit disproportionately in comparison to their actual work but their cut is determined by their role as a gate keeper of the industry and using it to take massive cuts of the money generated by the artistsbands That would be more for new artists trying to break in For established artists Im thinking like Pandora and Spotify who dont pay artists shit for their streams A lot of artists dont give those streamers the rights to play their music bc they dont pay the artists hardly anything for it Those are just a few examples though I am making an assumption that there are more,0,0,1,0,1

No I dont think everyone who has a negative opinion is a bot that isnt even a logical takeaway from what I said If everyone who was against NFTs was a bot then no humans would be against NFTs and there would be no real negative sentiment bc all negative sentiment would be bots That doesnt make sense bc I do believe there are humans who are negative on NFTs obviously So just to make sure youre following along I believe there are actual people who dont wantlike the idea of NFTs I think that of those actual people who dont like NFTs a significant majority formed their negative opinion based on a formula that is paid for generally by the leeches who will be burned by the implementation of NFTs So the formula is humans hear the topic of NFTs talked about by corporate media in a way that presents a misrepresentation of the purposeuse casevulnerabilities of NDTs Then those humans see comments posted by bots who are expressing negative conclusions and takeaways of the corporate media presentations The actual people then decide they agree with the conclusions posted primarily by bots at first Humans decide that they have been presented a reasonable conclusion based on the information and viewpoints they were limited to still not universal there are inevitably going to be some exceptions Then actual humans start to echo the same sentiments as the bots by making their own posts online I find it hard to believe that people are organically already harshly against something they literally know nothing about and havent used At most it would be a neutral position of not caring Again I am not claiming that anything at all is universal There are always exceptions to everything,0,1,0,0,1
pretty much everyone knows about NFTs now theyve heard that people are spending hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on bad digital art theyve seen the cringe associated with the culture thats enough for most people to form a negative opinion Im not against the concept of an NFT but I dont think that paid shills or bots have had an impact on the publics perception of NFTs the associated culture has ridiculed itself enough you dont need to pay people to do that,0,1,1,0,0
NFTs are not exclusively digital art music They are unique and identifiable digital contracts on the blockchain network Music and art pieces are just the easiest use cases to start with and therefore the first to gain some popularity People are finding out about NFTs from somewhere and if that somewhere was from people invested in the NFT space people would know that this is just the tip of the iceberg of how they can be used Once digital marketplaces start popping up they will be more accessible and more creative use cases will start showing up This is not a secret if you know anything about NFTs or are getting info from people who know anything about NFTs Sure some people will take a peek listen to no one about how they will be used in the future determine they know everything about them and that there will be no further developments that come from NFTs bc thats typically what happens with brand new tech s And also youve said it yourself theyve heard about people spending millions of dollars on bad digital art etc Theyve heard about the worst possible cherrypicked examples of how NFTs can and will be used from who?,0,1,0,1,0
I understand that its good tech and quite promising but Im not talking about theoretical or fringe uses of NFTs the vast majority of NFTs are currently not only just collectible art but bad loweffort and often overpriced art the motives of people who mint and trade them are often questionable this is the current state of NFTs and so this is what the public has been exposed to,0,1,0,0,1

The first thing that comes to mind is that you could have both I collect vinyl records and will continue to forever Perhaps there is a way where you can have easy streaming accessSpotify Pandora and a selection of personally owned NFTs possibly not released on Spotify Many punk bands and labels I listen to withhold their music from them The only way I can get it is direct from the artist via Bandcamp or finding hard copies,0,0,0,1,0

Artists can also make their own smart contracts or collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain Smart contracts remove any reliance on a middleman or a record label Artists can code a contract themselves to ensure that theyre paid appropriately for their work as it sells and resells and deploy it when they release their NFTs Emphasis mine If you share this article with others not as familiar this is a huge point to mention,1,0,0,1,0

I would argue that we could accomplish what Spotify does but better If artists got together and added songs and albums to a pool and sold subscriptions to that pool essentially what Spotify does they can eliminate the middleman and earn more money I agree buying each individual song or album is annoying but i think theres a middle ground to be found If people arent willing to buy albums for inflated prices then no one will buy those expensive albums and they will be forced to sell them for cheaper Either way songs themselves will be cheaper due to the fact that theres no middleman What value does Spotify provide that cant be accomplished by smart contracts? Maybe the UI and stuff like that but nothing that cant be copied in the future Im not sure how the pay is even distributed for Spotify artists though Id assume the popular ones get paid nice but some of the smaller ones probably get shafted I just think a smart contract system would be more transparent and ensure artists are getting fairly compensated for their work,1,1,0,1,0
gtwhat value does Spotify offer that smart contracts cant? You may like algorithms and playlist sharing You pay Spotify and you get a feed of music tailored to your interests Consumers arent going to want to return to curating their own music,0,1,0,0,1
That is true The algorithm is something of value Playlist sharing is something fairly simple that could doesnt necessarily need a big corporation like Spotify to do Overall though the price you pay vs the value you receive just isnt worth it Especially once smart contracts get up and running lets see just how long Spotify can maintain their competitive advantage,0,1,0,0,1

Also the fact that anything an NFT does has already been done without blockchain tech Valve has been doing the NFT thing for about a decade now and it never required any hoop jumping Simply put NFTs are overcomplicated ecosystem ruining databases They solve absolutely nothing and even if they somehow did governments arent going to support them The people that think turning something into an NFT is going to magically make it work in other games where these companies and studios would have to deal with lawyers copyright issues legal rights how different game engines handle them and a myriad of other problems shows how little the people peddling this trash know about it,0,1,1,0,0

minecraft is already rife with people selling their own third party microtransactions in someone elses game so many bullshit P2W servers that blatantly break mojangs EULA and yet they hardly care to do anything about them as these servers exploit kids with abusive shitty lootboxes and crap,0,0,1,0,1
You could use the TF2 method to partially mitigate things Servers that want to tie into the official authentication systems need to be tied to a platform account The platform takes abuse reports If a server is acting outside of the rules the platform account is banned from hosting or just generally and the server can no longer interact with the official authentication system Servers which dont interact with the official auth system present a warning to connecting users and information about how to report unauthorized content There are ways for servers to mitigate the inconvenience of not having access to the official auth servers but its an inconvenience nonetheless and they could also send CampDs to thirdparty hosts to have them address users which are using their services to host violating servers,0,0,0,1,1
The simple solution is to sell your own servers and not allow third party ones Then you would need official mod acceptance Which is very unlikely to happen so if nfts ever take off custom servers might be a thing of the past,0,1,0,0,1
With RMT you arent sure any money changed hands And the items are generic ingame items So there is no trail to follow With this kind of garbage the NFTs are on a blockchain somewhere You can find them there then look for the hashes to show up for items in your game This seems much easier to stop than RMT for normal items,0,1,0,0,1

There are a few possible ways to monetize this For example transaction fees within your ecosystem Allowing 3rd party NFT trading in your ecosystem means you can collect a transaction fee on it and any resales that happen within your ecosystem Allowing a 3rd party microtransaction means that you can collect money on people selling something you put no work into making And it requires very little overhead Its basically free money Edit Getting downvoted for answering the question way to go reddit,0,0,1,1,0
None of that requires or benefits from using an NFT I could simply let creators upload their whatever to my platforms store and then let users trade them around Steam Marketplace style Whatever entitlement the NFT represents has to be bundled within the games code anyway so it can to be displayed to other users in the game You need an internal authentication scheme as well to ensure that players can only use the elements theyre entitled to Involving a third party only means someone else I have to cut in,0,1,1,0,0
Could you elaborate a bit on this?

Other than the guys trying to wear them as weird status items most people are sitting on NFTs as speculative stores of value which inherently relies on convincing someone else that the thing theyre holding onto is worth more money than they paid for it ideally a lot more But theres no meaningful end game other than to repeating the process with the same hope of leaving someone else with the object Often the object itself is an ugly procedurally generated piece of art that almost no one would outside of NFTs even want to own They arent selling useful goods or services they arent meant to be enjoyed or admired theyre someones pure profit motive And it shows,0,1,0,0,1
Oh the question was rhetorical Im aware that basically every monetaryfinancial implementation of the blockchain is effectively a bigger loser scheme Where the goal is to inflate the price as high as you can by pretending its valuable and trying to take some sucker dumber than you are by selling as close to the high as possible Its why whenever theres a shock to the value of Crypto you watch it PLUMMET When every intelligent person involved in it knows that the end game is to bail before the bottom falls out anything that looks like the bottom falling out is a sign to sell During the recent avalanche you saw people selling like MAD while the grifters whose worthless investments were now worth less than they paid for them were busy trying to convince anyone dumb enough to listen that the lower prices made THIS the PERFECT time to invest Here theyll even sell you some to get you started! Im always reminded of the big thing around GOLD in the early 2000s Everyone talking about what a stable investment it was demonstrably false and so eager to help YOU get started with this wonderful investment opportunity by selling you their gold My question was always If this stuff is such a sure thing why arent you holding on to it?

Its often the injection of the blockchain solely for the purpose of extracting money out of something that already can or could exist without it From pump and dump schemes where people look to speculate on inherently worthless digital commodities hoping to get in on the ground floor so that they can maximize screwing someone else out of the most money possible and leave them holding the bag to some of the worst and most exploitative kinds of video games Things like games where digital property holders own avatars that they then have what are essentially virtual laborers operating in order to grind out virtual currency with the vast share going to the property holder Often the things people want to do with the web30 are either redundant or even worse counterintuitive sometimes being a liability due to the inflexible nature of the blockchain or that require a centralized data source in order to function anyway Sometimes proponents will mention some niche project that isnt actively hostile to the wellbeing of its end users and that could possibly do some good But odds are thats not the project theyre invested in which is probably some shitcoin they have an early start with and that they hope people will buy off them so they can go cash out into fiat currency because things like crypto that people want to do nothing but speculate on make poor currencies,0,1,1,0,1
gt internet 20 Its web3 after web 20 social mediauser generated content after web 10 static sites simple blogs That wiki article also mentions that web 30 is sometimes used to describe the semantic web machine understandable web so it had to be web3 without the 0 for blockchain tech so they have a higher version number Its technically supposed to be a distributed web thing No dependencies on centralised services like social media sites that host everything think bit torrent but as a protocol underneath everything web related Its just that they religiously want blockchain and cryptocurrency bullshit to be the foundation of everything and start some digital libertarian utopia,0,1,0,0,1

As I recall the first round of the web wasnt dominated by the paradigm of producer and consumer Anyone that could spend 10 minutes learning HTML could create a webpage Some interior folks like yours truly hosted a web server in their living room running Windows with a static IP address It was trivial to do for anyone with the interest The folks who are accustomed to AOL were accustomed to only being consumers They didnt do much but got the chat rooms with endless ASL requests or searching for porn But the rest of us were merrily posting images using hyperlinks to each others sites etc The Web 20 definition currently out there is very much a self serving interpretation the companies that crowned themselves the official way to get content published came up with to maintain the producerconsumer divide It made a lot of folks silent somewhere really uncomfortable to have people literally publishing whatever they wanted without concern that theyd run afoul of someones taste or TOS,0,1,0,1,0

The idea of Web3 is a version of the Internet that is heavily decentralized The selling point here is that no one person or entity can moderate with brute force what is available and what stays available We already have a working version of this in Torrents where several people make available a common resource in a decentralized manner However web3 falls apart rapidly under the technical requirements of the Internet Accessing data over a blockchain is slow Really really slow Several orders of magnitude slower then most database configs people would use today Writing data to a blockchain is even worse in both access time and bandwidth Trying to scale a blockchain tech as a general purpose data store to the demands of the modern Internet is technically impossible Web3 is dead to rights against any technical scrutiny and we dont really have to go any further then that But we can! The nature of how a decentralized database works is that no one entity has ultimate authority as to what data exists on it So this is cute in concept but if you write wrong data to your data backend because of a software bug you cant exactly just go and fix it now Its just there now The solutions to fix it are inelegant complicated and disruptive There is no such thing as administrating the data in a blockchain Unless you can provoke a consensus attack Blockchains frequently work on the idea of consensus The data is what it is at the pleasure of the majority How the majority is measured is different but if you are something like Ethereum or Bitcoin its measured by your stake in the blockchain So this would mean that if someone ever obtains 51 of the available currency they could just write transactions arbitrarily to the blockchain and since they are now the majority the rest of the blockchain would fall in line How this would work with a data backend would be different but if you dont want a central authority then a consensus attack is an everpresent threat For all these reasons and more Web3 is dead on arrival It solves no problems It may as well translate to Ponzi Scheme with extra steps,0,1,0,0,1
gtWeb3 also known as Web 30123 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization blockchain technologies and tokenbased economics4 Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 20 wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as Big Tech5 The term Web3 was coined in 2014 by Ethereum cofounder Gavin Wood and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts large technology companies and venture capital firms56 gtSome commentators argue that Web3 will provide increased data security scalability and privacy for users and combat the influence of large technology companies7 Others have raised concerns about a decentralized web citing the potential for low moderation and the proliferation of harmful content8 the centralization of wealth to a small group of investors and individuals9 or a loss of privacy due to more expansive data collection10 Others such as Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey have argued that Web3 only serves as a buzzword or marketing term ,1,1,0,0,1
The core idea is interesting as it relies on the blockchain to allow ownership of web content In an idealized world this moves the ownership of the web back to the people who use it instead of the corporations that currently make up the most popular websites In practice its an unregulated hellhole of scammers operating in a legal nomansland using FOMO to steal peoples money,0,1,0,0,1

How could this work without either of these issues happening? 1 NFTs being easy to acquire which means nobody will want to buy them from you severely neutering the P2E aspect 2 Valuable NFTs being extremely hard to acquire which gives them a significant monetary value but this means that getting the best cars and being competitive either requires an incredibly rare random drop gambling or paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to buy one from another player,0,1,0,0,1

Im not paying for microtransactions to begin with The only thing Im paying for is traditional DLC and the most Ive ever spent on that adds up to less than 1 per car with additional tracks on top of that and I can have as many of each car as I want There is no way NFTs would make that less expensive Just look at the Auction House in Forza Horizon 5 You can only get the Toyota Trueno from limited time events or from other players so the cheapest one in there at the moment has a buyout of 4000000 credits If you let people trade cars for actual money the vast majority those players definitely wouldnt give you that car for 1 even if the car could still be obtained for free and there were millions of them in circulation People arent going to charge next to nothing when theres a limited number of a car in circulation which there would have to be or else thered be no reason for NFTs to be involved in the first place Even if the cars did cost next to nothing then that would mean that Id get next to nothing if I were to sell them so whats the point? The only reason to be excited about NFTs in a racing game would be the prospect of gaining a substantial amount of money by selling cars which means youd have to pay other players a substantial amount of money if you actually want to drive those cars which I do because its a racing game,0,1,1,0,0
gtWould love to own my digital assets While you could be able to own your assets with NFTs the devs dont need to challenge your ownership to screw you up Lets say you own an NFT for Badass Sword of Rampage for some MMO Fine you own the sword Now the devs decide that the sword is actually hurting the PVP balance So they change the game code to still recognize your NFT but the game will process the sword differently They can make sword to do 10 of original damage or even make it unequippable And you wouldnt be able to do anything about it because your ownership of the sword would remain unchanged,0,0,1,0,1

So basically what you are talking about is Steam but significantly worse combined with a cumbersome and inefficient resale system? What do you think happens when the centralized market place shuts down? Do you think users would then operate the network like a decentralized exchange? In that case how is the game supposed to verify that you are actually the current owner of a license You would need the game to connect to and examine the blockchain Youd still be dependent on a single centralised entity Not to mention that Publishers would never sign on unless they got some degree of control over the licenses post initial sale Fees are another question In short an NFT based digital license resale would have practically no advantage over steam just allowing users to trade licenses between each other Something that Steam has experimented with in the past but ended up scrapping due to pushback from publishers The idea is very interesting Having actual digital property that can be traded But NFTs at least with currently popular and available technology just cant do that You can achieve individual bits of that idea but you cant do that without introduce massive deal breaking caveats There just is no reason to use NFTs for reselling of digital games right now it could be perfectly well implemented with existing technology and would likely work considerably better too,0,1,0,0,1
gt You keep talking about ways to make it work It already works It gives true unique resellable ownership Give it a shot before blasting it It doesnt give you true unique resealable ownership It only give you unique ownership on the specific version of the blockchain that happens to be accepted And how unique and true is your ownership if it entirely depends on a third parties continuing support of a platform That is the exact same problem with Steam Except steam doesnt also require your to make your entire game library and transaction history public record and steam also doesnt inherently require DRM in games sold on the platform Sure you could make an NFT based license for a game that doesnt require DRM but whats the point of a license then anyway if it doesnt govern access to the game? Im not saying that it doesnt work Im saying that it doesnt work any better than a solution without NFTs or any sort of blockchain technology And that its probably worse in terms of usability convenience and security Which isnt unique to this particular application These flaws are with NFTs themselves It doesnt matter what arbitrary thing you tie to them these flaws will always exist At least with the currently used technology Want to resell your games? Get physical copies That gives you true unique ownership A license to play a game isnt unique Its a mass product every single one is identical At best you have different editions There is absolutely no benefit from arbitrary tying it to a blockchain,0,1,0,0,1

gtHow do I trade skins on fortnite? How can I sell the ones I dont want? If the company doesnt want to allow selling of skins then they wont allow it on blockchain Why do people like you think that the existence of NFTs will make companies do 180 on their policies? If Epic wanted to allow for selling skins in Fortnite they would have already done it even without blockchain gtWill my skin be crossplatform to different games? Only if the creators making the other games allow it And why would they allow it? Why would PUBG allow you to use Fortnite skins and make 0 dollars when they can sell you the skin themselves and make ALL the money from it? Think please think Skins are not transferable between games theres no universal format and every game has different graphic style and even body proportions To use a skin in a game the devs have to remake it from scratch suited for their game So if they allowed for use of external skins they would have to spend dev time on skins that dont make them money Thats why crossgame skinsitems are out of question unless its games made by the same company gtI can do that with my NFT You can to do it with your data but not in games of other companies Theres zero incentive for the companies to accept external NFTs Some companies are experimenting with NFTs only because of the hype from the crypto community But those are still NFTs exclusive to one game They will never allow you to import other NFTs because they wont make money from it,0,1,1,0,1
why would companies want to do a 180 on their policies? Because Epic games is suing Apple for wanting a 30 cut of all ingame purchases All creator content with NFTs goes to the original creator plus royalties when its resold Content creators recognize that long lasting games with communities and continual growth are more value able than making brand new games every second year NFTs creates an ecosystem and strengthens the community You own your assets you value them more and can also make a profit if you decide to flip it You know how Epic Games will make money? If people keep playing Epics games If their ingame purchases are unreal engine crossplatform people will stay in Epics games longer Idk seems pretty straight forward to me Heres the traditional gaming profit model make a half built game and make purchase walls to have more access use loot boxes for rare items that then get disposed when you get bored on the game make customers pay for the rights to download the game rather than having ownership Notice something similar to this model? Its a linear system Your money into their pocket But do the creators get all the profits? No It goes to the middleman like steam and Apple stores that requires high percentage of royalties NFTs removes the middleman Takes away the financial leech I want to own the shit I buy! And I want to resell it People will flock towards what is the cheapest Would you buy a 60 skin when I can sell it to you for 40? The answer is yes! It opens the market to more people with affordability Thats my argument And if you get lucky you can buy something that might have a high demand with low quantity and have a possession that is worth thousands My Clone Card will give me lifetime drops of new skins and avatars that I can resell if I dont like them My 100 purchase is now up for sale at 1300 Your digital skins have crazy value and greedy gaming productions dont want you to see that They want you to keep pumping DLC content that ultimately ends In the trash Things are changing and it gives more power to the original creators and the ownerscommunity I like those principles,1,1,1,1,0

Its a neat idea but emphasizing the ownership aspects or the idea that youll somehow make money playing video games is not convincing anyone The value is in the decentralized trading piece and not much else It would be cool for a game to let you sync a wallet inventory and see what tokens items are in it in order to add those to your ingame inventory while letting players transfer those tokens amongst one another to trade items Thats the part that players might actually care about hence them already doing it today with Steam but a decentralized inventory is never catch on as long as people keep hammering ownership or play to earn nonsense,0,1,0,1,0

Its not though Because they can just as easily make them worthless which does much the same thing Its inherently reliant on a central authority to recognize your tokens whether they use something like Steam to store them or the blockchain Thats intrinsic to the nature of how a digital item in a video game works someone has to program the thing to provide you with meaningful functionality Its not even like it provides you with protection there are plenty of ways people use to scam others out of their NFTs but its also just possible to outright forget your wallet and be unable to recover it You probably wont lose your Steam account in the ether at least,0,1,0,0,1

The case of Amiibos demonstrate how you certainly dont need the blockchain to pull this off and that they still have value outside their use in games as being physical collectables as well Youll also notice that theyre essentially their own ecosystem Theres little point to recognizing the tokens outside the use cases Nintendo intended for them Again that sort of functionality doesnt need a blockchain to work if its all centralized around a given developerpublisher gt If a line of NFTs got popular enough companies would even begin to design games around them There are already NFT games and theyre fucking awful Some of the worst examples imaginable of exploitative gameplay are thanks to cryptobased games,0,1,1,0,1

But a token representative of an in game item that the games developers and the game itself doesnt respect is a worthless item Shit you can do that right now!

Any in game functionality is still inherently left to the centralized authority the game owner They can at any time just opt to not recognize your tokens and all youve got are a bunch of worthless receipts You cant even say you really have what it is your token is supposed to be because nothing stops them from changing the item in game You mention other games recognizing your token but theres nothing that requires the blockchain to do this Theres also very little incentive for a company to do so in the sort of wild unregulated manner blockchain proponents talk about them You arent going to buy a digital sword and cart it over to some other game like the developer just has to accept that youve got this item by virtue of owning an NFT Not if they dont want to anyway,0,1,0,0,1
If a company tried to fuck over their player base another company would just spring up honoring the original tokens In all cases the tokens retain some value and possibly increase Companies can already totally fuck over players by turning off their servers and they do it all the time NFTs just gives the players a little more freedom and power Thats a good thing At this point Im getting this same reply so often Im just copying and pasting this response and it would take too long to reply individually Sorry youre not worthy of an individual reply next time maybe try to say something original,0,1,1,0,0

No? Well why not if youre claiming that another company would simply spring up and honor the original tokens? Weve already got all these physical tokens that people can sell and trade theres nothing fundamentally stopping people from building something thats interoperable with them why hasnt it happened?,0,1,1,0,0
They cant take the token but they can take away the actual thing that gives a token its value which is essentially the same thing If I have a token that represents the ownership of a cool magical sword in a game and the game developers decide to do anything to it they can If they say the sword is a banana you now own a token that represents a banana If they nerf or delete the item you now own a token that represents something that has no function effectively making it worthless They never touched your token and you still own it but you have no control over the value or representation of the token,0,0,1,0,1
But they cant stop a secondary company from releasing their own title honoring the token and they cant stop free trade of the tokens If a company tried to fuck over their player base another company would just spring up honoring the original tokens In all cases the tokens retain some value and possibly increase Companies can already totally fuck over players by turning off their servers and they do it all the time NFTs just gives the players a little more freedom and power Thats a good thing,1,1,0,0,0
You have said multiple time in this thread a company would pop up and utilize the tokens in another game but why would they do that? They get no profit from allowing tokens purchases from outside their game and ecosystem so why invest the man hours to implement it?

the company cannot take it from you but they sure as hell can just turn off the servers making your token entirely worthless I cant think of a single reason why a developer would spend the time and effort not to mention the potential disaster of dealing with attribution rights copyright game balance to include support for players being able to use items from other game Especially since they can just sell you that item or one that looks like it themselves,0,0,1,0,1

I dont think you and other people pushing for this realize how much work it would be for individual games so support assets from other games even something as simple as a weapon skin How are you going to distribute the data? does every game include all NFT skins or does the token include download information If the latter Who is responsible for maintaining that data storage who pays for traffic and hosting what happens if that storage goes down? Say you are a game developer looking to support NFT skins for your shooter What format is the model in? is that even compatible with the engine your game is running? Is it correctly positioned and rigged for the animation system your game uses? If not who is responsible for fixing that? Heck which weapon does this skin even apply to? Does the developer decide that? or the player? How do you deal with stuff like weapon accessories like scopes or grips Lets say you minted a custom skin and make the files available to be used in other games Unfortunately the company goes under the game shuts down and the assets are bought up by a different company who do not use NFTs They own the rights to the skin and model now They could demand fees for using their property There are too many things to consider too many things that can go wrong AT BEST I can see developers letting you use something like a player icon from a different game which we can already do,0,1,1,0,1

Any sort of functionality out of an NFT inherently relies on someone opting to recognize it and coding whatever functionality they want around it Theyre free to not recognize it or to choose how they want to recognize it Your ownership of a token might be out of their hands but all the things that actually give it any value are their choice,0,1,0,0,1

Where do you imagine this going? Theres nothing about the blockchain that decouples meaningful control away from the developers here Ive seen proponents argue that you can buy and sell them free of the developer but ultimately only if the developer still agrees to recognize your tokens do they hold any real functionality It also supposes that this is a sort of thing people want in their games because they sure arent something we all agree are a good thing in video games Real money transactions were just about the worst part of Diablo 3 at launch in no small part because it meant itemization was tuned around their value as real life commodities and not the fun a lootbased action game creates getting food items Stuff like crossgame functionality doesnt require the blockchain to pull off and proponents dont really talk about the incentives a developer would have recognizing a token they might not have anything to do with the money changing hands over them,0,1,0,0,1

Theres some misguided people out there that think they will be able to use their NFTs across multiple games magically It could happen but it would require the developers collaborating just like any other cross collaboration that happens in games I personally like the idea of being able to collect and own things that I earn in a game and being able to trade them easily I know this has been done and can be done without the blockchain but developers arent interested in it I played hearthstone for years and i always wished i could just buy a card from a different player but they wanted me to gamble on packs instead The other benefit im seeing from NFT games is potential for several aspects of the game to be community owned as well Imagine like being able to own a flightpath in WoW and getting a percentage of the fees spent on traveling and then if someone owns an eagle they can lend it to the flightpath to get some of the fees as well Again we dont need blockchain for a game like this but no one else is trying to make games like this Blockchain mainly just makes it more seamless to move assets between different gamesecosystems Theres also projects being set up as DAOs decentralized autonomous organization where developers claim that the community will ultimately have the final say and the developers themselves could technically be removed from the project if the community voted that way Who knows where any of that will go though I will say one thing that I am enjoying about following nft game projects thus far is that the developers are super engaged with the community in most projects and you get to really see the game get built bit by bit and often times to get play various builds throughout the process Lastly I like how some nft game projects are set up economically A lot of them have planned revenue distribution for investors assuming they ever generate revenue One game im invested in does 100 revenue distribution to all token holders naturally the developers have hold a good amount of tokens I have actually received some revenue from that game Im definitely skeptical that any of these projects will be truly mainstream but i think you kinda have to enjoy investing and playing games to see any value in them So i understand why gamers hate the idea of NFTs and honestly I highly doubt any of the implementations from the bigger developers will bring any value to the players I do however think theres some good nft game projects out there but time will tell,1,1,0,1,0

There were some fun examples NFTs where the stolen artwork was hosted on some Google cloud service or Google Drive? Artists found it easier to complaint to Google a company thats notoriously difficult to deal with as a single customer due to their focus on automatedAI systems over customer support people about copyright infringement and get the files deleted than to ask NFT peddlers to stop selling the artists work and plagiarising them The result was that the NFTs which are more or less digital receiptsweak pseudoDRM had not source file to point at Imagine if your shopping cart were to magically lose wares the moment you exit the store Thats how it worked for those buyers They had the receipts for something but the link to the work inon their NFT points at an empty spot on a google server And yeah a lot of the crypto currency and NFTs are hosted on centralised systems from the hardware like AWS andor MS Azure whatever Googles system is called for the software some cobbled together and insecure content management system because its convenient and because they needed a trusted system to make it work in the first place Its ridiculous all the downsides of a distributed system combined with all the downsides of a centralised system The worst of both worlds What a revolutionary idea!,0,1,1,0,1

Web 3 is a very clear movement by large corporations to get ahead of incoming privacy laws by getting explicit consent to use and abuse personal data nothing good will come of how it actually get implemented I promise you that Lots of people think DAOs will be counter to corporatism but it will in practice be corporatism and bureaucracy on steroids It ends up creating more problems than it solves with no one to hold accountable when things go really wrong,0,1,1,0,1
DAOs are truly a moronic idea There is a reason companies have settled on tried and tested corporate structures that are prevalent in countries across the world backed by legislation that confer legal rights to shareholders The idea that a bunch of people can collaborate remotely to create value without a company but using shady entity called DAO is hilarious Infact its so bad that most of DAO rests on web2 despite DAOs claiming they are advancing web3 A DAO typically means joining on Discord Twitter and the like spending hours chatting with other smooth brains on now the latest crypto token can be pumped while pretending it is a legit use case and not a ponzi scam that borrows from Tom to pay Harry Shares of a company rights to cashflow of a company that generates real world revenue DAO token join this latest Discord group that has a sole agenda of pumping this DAO token that has zero real world utility and even within crypto land has pretty bad utility,0,1,1,0,1

Every intelligent person starts off as a sceptic and since you are one of those intelligent people I feel that you are worth the time it will take me to explain something important There are different types of cryptos not all of them are even blockchains hashgraph and DAG for example and some of them have features that differentiate them from basic blockchains like Bitcoin One of the largest differentiating factors is that some blockchains are considered Web3 or smart contract chains These chains allow you to run applications just like in the google play or ios app stores These applications can be games that allow you to own your in game characters and assets and resell or upgrade them or use them in other games or financial applicaitons like decentralized banking and lending or tokenized real world assets that allow you to prove ownership and trade these assets easily homes cars etc another application is digital identity and credit scores that will prevent identity theft in the future These Web3 applications described are just the tip of the iceberg When comparing these chains think of Bitcoin as MS DOS and chains like Ethereum as Windows 10 The Web3 chain called the internet computer allows any normal Web2 website to be deployed on the blockchain and gain web3 functionality This could allow people to easily send each other USD on any website or allow any website to have other decentralized finance identity or tokenized asset integration Clones of Reddit Twitter Facebook and more already exist on the internet computer,0,1,0,1,0

amp#x200B Hi everybody amp#x200B With the current hype lets talk about NFTs DAOs Web3 the metaverse and why is this the future I would like to put emphasis on NFTs being mostly value and will be calculated according to their fundamentals depending on the project and service is providing what is backing it can be swapped exchanged and transformed into currency could be into fiat currency but more like a smart bank check that is flexible for the next era a middleman facilitator to exchange a product service fulfil a need NOT the main product as is being used currently in form of art as the first way to use it but no the future potential of it NFTs have the potential to be the internal currency of a DAO decentralized autonomous organization just like dollars are to a business like GameStop to trade items from the website NFTs are a new better version of bank checks since they are smart Can be used like currency after is traded since is value but also I think is better to see them as smart checks a check which individually has a separate value Lets dig a bit more into this amazing world Note that NFTS have many different application and not just this but this in particular is the one that will help changing the current corrupted financial banking system fractional banking based in fiat Edited thanks to an ape in the comments to help me clarify this part amp#x200B Since most of those concepts are hard to grasp and tend to be misleading or a tough to understand Lets me smooth it out for you # WEB3 Era of VerificationValidaton amp#x200B Web3 simplified amp#x200B This has been around lately so what is Web3 and how is it different to the internet we know it? Right now we are living in the Web2 world and what means is that the current state of the internet as a whole is basically in an interactive read only web1 was static read only information with interactive means that you are able to upload content like videos photos chat and interact in reality time You can upload information read it make copies of it but you cant verify it to the internet and no one is able to verify validate or own the information The era of information read only interactive is web2 without an external source to confirm any of this data here is a bit more in depth information and comparisson between Web1 Web2 and Web3 # THE FUTURE Now imagine that there is a way that a third party is able to confirm and validate pieces of data confirming that the data is correct and assigning it a unique space in a blockchain That third party is a ledgerbased blockchain the one best suited to perform this duty currently is Ethereum thats why GME is working based on etherium But what do I care about validation? How is that affects me in the real world? This opens a huge door of opportunities lets explore some Web3 will evolve systems like a country registration of IDs for example Currently there is a project called ENS Ethereum Name Service this project allows anybody to link their Crypto Wallet to their Ethereum identity ENS your name is minted in an unique block NFT and no one else can have that name you will have effectively an unique validated and verifiable ID on the blockchain So far its your nameeth example Meloneth That ledger can effectively replace Passports and mint your Identity as an NFT Holberg principal engineer at GameStop design this NFT application called HODLBERG # This is how HODLBERG works amp#x200B amp#x200B Hodlberg TLDR amp#x200B Hodlberg explained amp#x200B # Drivers License Now imagine you been able to validate verified by the entire Ethereum network your drivers license online the equivalent of having millions of people looking at your driving license and saying Yep Yep thats real or Nop Nop is not Creating that UNIQUE block no one else can have your same license number or document is an NFT you can link it to your wallet and all browser will be able to connect with your wallet and confirm you identity and your drivers license on the internet for anyone to see and verify decentralized No more queues on the airport you can easily sign any document with your ENS Meloneth and be as valid as your passport country ID or driving license its verified by a decentralized authority Lets go to a another example # The car registry With this you can create a UNIQUE entry of every single car every car has an unique manufacturing VIN number I can create an UNIQUE block NFT with those unique features and name my car but also I can link it with a proof of ownership such a receipt or another registries There cant be two cars with the same VIN number and characteristics physically also now I can link that NFT to my wallet and trade my ownership online Validated With the security of the entire Ethereum blocks chain network This are just 23 examples But the limits no limits The future Another word that needs to be understood is Metaverse # THE METAVERSE amp#x200B The metaverse amp#x200B Its basically a bridge between reality and web3 using Augmented reality or virtual reality the attempt to replicate real life experience but digitally like going to the movies or a concert or shopping at the mall With web3 you can validate your identity yourself online and use your NFT to trade for a ticket pair of shoes a car electronics and anything you imagine digitally and real life So you would be able to go to a virtual GameStop store and talk to a customer rep or an NPC and preview items on a digital form in 3D it will evolve into looking like reality itself not far from ready player one hu? Lets continue amp#x200B # So what are DAOs NFTS Zkrollups Layers 2 and Loopring? amp#x200B # DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization amp#x200B DAO structure amp#x200B DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization pretty much like a regular businessproject but the intention is not to have a single controlling partyowner Hence decentralized and autonomous amp#x200B This projects will have a set of rules smart rules set by the creator taylormade thinking about the community and shareholders to serve The people that wants to participate will follow those guidelines according to the project amp#x200B Markets are based on trust so the Creator needs to make sure that the rules are fair for everyone and also that the project purpose can attract and benefit a community of shareholders with a common interest could be anything amp#x200B The more people and bigger community more value and resources are throw into the DAO more brains giving feedback and helping faster and bigger expansion to similar or new ventures by the entire community not just the creator more trades happening so everyone gets their share from more pies the project will grow and so is the Value of their NFTs the tokens amp#x200B The opposite can happen if the project is not up to the standards if doesnt satisfy a need low quality products and just like a bad managed company or a scam Ill eventually go down so its about trust amp#x200B Where to put money in? Thats up to you to find out according to each project fundamentals and purpose which one adapts to your knowledge expertise hobbies likes feeling or however you make decisions Then you can support your DAOs each NFT you will have will be part of a DAO so dig on what the project is about before deciding to invest or not amp#x200B Always educated decisions are problemless decisions thats my opinion amp#x200B Remember that these are smart contractsprojects means that the idea is to Taylor made each contract according to the creator the community is aimed for and the project itself to survive and be sustainable amp#x200B A more fair market So the bigger the project and more valuecurrency is inside the more valuable the DAO will become the more will grow and expand amp#x200B Just like companies work in real life right now just that doesnt have to answer to a government first too amp#x200B its going to be easy for everyone to adapt since its pretty similar just clean and transparent Lets go to nfts amp#x200B # NFT NonFungible Token amp#x200B Smart money constantly changing and evolving Look at it as smart money a money that is smart and can change in value constantly thats also why is so important to get into a money with strong fundamentals that the DAO provides for good value and stability just like you rather to have US dollars or Euros backed by a bigger goverment DAO rather than for example a peso that might lose value overtime faster Where all this come from? From a need for decentralization Let me explain in a simple version about the future of markets finance and GME People are often seeing crypto as a casino to go in there and bet to make money not actually basing themselves on the project fundamentals Fundamentals in a project is what makes the project their approach to solve a need the serviceproduct they are providing how is gonna perform towards the future and how is providing the solution for that need Right now everyone has a need for a different financial sector due to the current market being corrupt and manipulated based mostly in politics and whatever the fed HF whales and central banks do with it I recommend you to read my other posts about markets and The Infinite Money Glitch That completely disconnect the market from the fundamentals and performance of the projectscompanies So there is an urgent need to move to decentralized and bring back more democracy and global consensus instead of the 000001 controlling everything Cryptos L1 like Bitcoin or Ethereum or basically all cryptos have 2 big problems 1 Transaction speed Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second Etherium 30 per second compared to MasterCard that does 5000 per second cant be a viable option to use for a lot of people or a lot of transactions will create a massive queue of transactions that also bring to number 2 2 Transaction fees gas fees are priced based on supply and demand transaction queues will leave to have a constant high demand but low supply of transactions making them too expensive and a lot of the time even more expensive than the digitalreal asset you with to purchase # THE SOLUTION Zkrollups amp#x200B The solution for scaling beat mastercard 4000 transaction per minute amp#x200B So basically Loopring created a winzip like tool by creating a off chain copy of a blockchain with massive scale ability up to 400k transactions per second Bundle all the transactions that happen on that L2 blockchain and send it to Etherium in massive batches splitting the cost to all the transactions make in it super cheap Transactions in L2 are super fast since is in a off chain blockchain while zkrollups allow to be that bridge to get the L2 constantly verified and validated by the entire L1 of ethereum everytime those batches occur amp#x200B To know more in depth info here is some material Watch this youtube video on the link bellow of Vitalik creator of Ethereum talking about Zkrollups and how he thinks Loopring is the solution for Ethereum problems of scaling and gas fees fees from using etherium Watch from 1hr1400 to 1hr1740 to understand Loopring and ZkRollups from his words The whole Rollups section is very interesting To know more about Zkrollups in depth I recommend to watch This video by Finematics Finematics video about Liquidity pools s also amazing to undertand thats in my other GME squeeze for DUMMIES amp#x200B amp#x200B Rollup functionality amp#x200B This is the future of currency finance and economy all in NFTs Basically what finance can do this can do it much better while keeping the transparency and high security of a blockchain consensus based of Ethereum also while maintaining democracy and avoiding creating bubbles or synthetic shares Keep in mind that there is something so beautiful on those projects and marketplaces the market place doesnt work for one institution or person like a bank and CEOs they work for the system itself Lets say you are a singer or have a band and your band releases your album but instead of selling it using dollars fiat decided to sell it using their tokens in L2 They split that song in 1million pieces first songs are sold for 1 worth of the token at the start Out of that 1 80 will go back to the entire network of owners of that bandalbum tokens 70 of those are spread across everyone and 10 is burnt to keep reducing the supply increasing the net worth The last 20 will go to the creatorartist always always that ratio Right now the standard I might say is 801010 So if you are part owner of any piece of that songalbum every time someone comes in or transaction that specific song EVERYONE WILL BENEFIT from it That is decentralized finance Thats based on fundamentals and that true value of investment you believe in the bandartist and the more sales and transaction and more popular becomes more value will bring back to the entire network # GME IN THE HOUSE amp#x200B GameStop Marketplace lets gooo! amp#x200B GME marketplace in DA HOUSE! amp#x200B Not only bringing top expertise on blockchain and NFTs but seen ahead to the future I based this on Ryan Cohen long friendship with finestone GME is gonna be the first massive project of this already been tested and working on Loopring L2 you can check yourself The possibilities are endless but lets keep it simple with one example Lets say that there is a new Mario Bros battle royale they decided to create 10 million copies of it and release them as an NFT 10 worth of GME coins in the GME L2 marketplace With those 10 you can play the game but also you own part of the project you can decide and participate in new updates and items released so give you more power towards the game But also if the game succeeds the tokens you have by selling the game if you decide to do so will be more valuable against those initial 10 because now the game market cap is gonna be bigger and we know decentralized market spread the spoils of sales to everyone that has that coin Also limiting the amount of copies will create that when all the copies at base rates are sold a auction market for the copies will be the only way to purchase that game and getting into the project then when there is higher demand and little supply boom! The price of the copies are gonna increase The NFT can store data so in your copy of the game you can have the items you unlocked or purchased in game or save files making your game unique and moreless valuable Also if this copy was owned originally by Ryan Cohen or any person that is famous you can see it and confirm it on the blockchain and that will also will give added value to those transactions in the market place making those copies more valuable For every of those transaction no matter the prices are trade on benefits THE ENTIRE NETWORK OF FANS and owners of the game Also keep in mind that this system is lot more intelligent than any other financial transaction these transactions are smart contracts meaning that you can set specific rules for the transactions For example I can limit a copy of the game to be sold only 5 times and if sold a 6th time will self destruct or can be only trades once every 5 days or that the increases on price can only go up by 5 tokens at the time controlling volatility and so on the list goes on with unlimited possibilities # TLDR NFTs are the new currency just like the dollar but smarter governments are forms of DAOs centralized ones and its gonna be very important to support DAOs with strong fundamentals that will gain value overtime just like you rather to have USD or Euros than pesos Web3 is knocking our doors the new age of validation the mix of technologies Opens new possibilities from creating your new Onlineoffline identity create your assets as NFTs to turn them into a digital asset and be able to trade it The Metaverse is the bridge between the internet and reality Using augmented and virtual reality to give a real life like experience while validating your virtual identity This is the future and true financial democracy GME is set to be the pioneers of this new technology that Vitalik himself Ethereum creator sees as the future Zkrollups is the current best solution to use Ethereum ledger for validation and security while keeping gas feed to less than a dollar and scaling the Transactions per second TPS to a better and faster functionality than current banking amp#x200B Above you will find a very easy to understand explanation of what is happening why and how is happening with real examples Please share for people that dont understand what blockchain is and educate a bit about the future of possibilities This is what I think they meant by POWER TO THE CREATORS POWER TO THE PLAYERS POWER TO THE COLLECTORS If any of you guys have any questions Ill be more than happy to answer is out Disclaimer Nothing in this post comments or any thoughtsopinions I might is or should be taken as financial advice This is educational purpose only Use your critical thinking and evaluate your particular situation with your financial advisor or professional always ask questions seconds opinions and educate yourself before any decision Common asked questions Talk about scarcity and value increase Why would that be desirable and sustainable? My answer The point is not about the actual increase or decrease of your value in reality this is a replacement of banks Lets say you have 100 in your bank account sitting in there that money goes to the market cap of the bank as an organization since they can use that money for themselves and you trust them with the keeping it they dont keep it With inflation today 62 your money by sitting still in the bank is actually losing value at that rate Thats why the more money you have the most likely is for you to invest it in things that at the very least give you that 62 of your losing value back Usually invested in government bonds which suppose to be safe and low risk since they are backed by the government and the government havent default ever yet So you put your trust that at the end they will give you your money back plus your yield 62 or more So even tho you have your 100 in your account anything else around is going up at an inflation rate 62 and suddenly your buying power is less less things you can buy with the same 100 dollars The bank used your 100 And lets say they doubles that money the on average get lot more than double but doesnt give you back anything really probably a very tiny of returns for you storing your money in the bank a lot of the time they charge you fees and actually take even more money and value from you This is the current system helps the banks and big institutions with your money Increasing the value of everything else also by printing counterfeit legal money at the FED and they call it QUANTITIVE EASING So there is a reason and need for a currency to grow in value to keep up with everything growing in value around it The token L1 will need a counter party currency to be exchanged most common is US Dollar that use the fiat system Blockchains have limited supply of token a set amount of tokens and the more currency injected to it US dollars for example the more market cap of that blockchain of tokens ethereum cap is currently 250 billion and the number of tokens supplied for ethereum is 1177 million tokenspieces You divide those numbers and should give you the price per piece The more people get into buying ethereum for example the bigger the market cap so bigger the price discovery Bonus Another example Lets imagine this situation In the current world we have The singer will go to a label to promote his album manager Spotify YouTube etc and they usually take the larger amount of the deals Now let me explain better how the model would work with NFTs DAOs A singer make one song and sell it to me in lets say 1 and put in the contract that each time that song is resold the singer gets 80 of the profit and 20 goes to the seller So I sold the song to somebody else then in this case the singer get 1 from my original sell plus 80 from my sell I get 20 of it everytime the song is resold 80 goes to the artist and 20 goes to the seller in the network No middle man like Spotify or Apple Music and the artist always gets its part and 20 for the seller You can do it on and on and on with always 8020 You had the song listened to it and when you sell that The owner will be the singer but everyone can listen to the song which is the product like games There are other models in which you can do 70 to the singer 20 for the reseller and burn 10 of the albums with that extra 10 of money to reduce the amount of supply of copies and making it more exclusive Increasing the amount of sales You can make it 5050 405010 its up to the project and the project goals Most standard currently is 801010 No one is forced to buy anyway and if the project is too greedy or doesnt benefit everyone so you are free not to join I think this explains it better so Im gonna add it to the post This are smart contracts and you can customize it according to what you need Dont forget that In comparison to the financial system we currently have you put money in the bank and they use it for their market cap to make more money for themselves giving you crumbs and you never owned a piece of the bank but you did invest in them by putting your money in for them to play with With blockchain you put your money in you actually own a part of the project and the project success is shared with everyone equally and proportionally of your stake of course So makes it easier to beat inflation and not letting others benefit from using your money to trade Another frequently asked question Whats the fundamental difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum? Both networks have a scaleability issues Both have high gas fees not efficient and both are solving those issues in different ways The fundamentals of Bitcoin are to be Nothing more than a coin The fundamentals of ethereum is a ledger technology that companies use to build programsprojects in it So fundamentally speaking Bitcoin would need to change their own fundamentals to be on par with Ethereum in order to provide a ledger and have rollups and similar ethereum based structures Fundamentally speaking amp#x200B Why Loopring? What LRC has to do with all this? This is my answer They are the ones and first that created a Zkrollup that is a key component on how the interaction between L1 and L2 works its the tool that compresses the off chain interactions from L2 Like Vitalik explained in the video takes only the validation part of the NFT taking just a minimal part of data to verify in the L1 of ethereum which is the most secured one and will be even more secure the bigger it gets with the coming of eth 20 and sharding multiplying eth 10 multiple times and connecting all in the network making huge scaling Then they take all the minimal parts together of each transaction in L2 off chain and compressed them into lot less making the cost of each transaction also be reduced by that amount of compression Thats how you can make a L2 transaction of NFTs of everything that has value in them and are validated of ownership in the ethereum blockchain ledger cost cents Ive seen the current Loopring L2 in developments and tested constantly cost cents I havent seen a transaction of a dollar yet and Ive been monitoring it and big movements transactions to Ethereum and fiat US dollars Hope that clears your mind and expand it Buy only on CS Hold DRS if needed I like to keep it simple stupid DFV a value investor based on fundamentals Source for the 30TPS for Ethereum some other courses claim 13TPS still pretty low for the needed demand in eth 10 Im a Melon this is not financial advice and shouldnt be taken that way This is me sharing my opinion and views Please do your own research develop and use your critical thinking and look things objectively Think for yourself,1,0,0,1,0

Another addition to the Bitcoin vs Ethereum section Bitcoin uses Proof of Work This means they need really powerful computers to mine blocks contribute to the blockchain 2 main downsides of PoW is that its much easier for the wealthy to buy the necssary hardware not as decentralized and all that hardware uses a metric fuckload of electricity Ethereum currently uses PoW but Eth 20 is in the works which will transition the protocol to Proof of Stake This means miners will offer up some monies stake that they will lose completely if they are caught being nefarious Miners are negatively incentivized to fuck up because they can lose their stake Many argue its a safer system and definitely uses less energy To clarify miners in either protocol can try to mess with the ledger but there is 0 consequence in the Bitcoin protocol Everyone just moves on,0,1,0,1,0

gtNFTs are gonna be the internal currency of a DAO decentralized autonomous organization just like dollars are to a business like gamestop to trade items from the website gt gtNFTs are the new currency just like the dollar but smarter I dont think above are accurate NFT is not the internal currency of a DAO A DAO can verify membership via NFT ownership which is minted via a contract that implements ERC721 or ERC1155 standards By currency of a DAO you probably mean a ERC 720 token which is fundamentally different from ERC721 So from first principles what is an NFT? An NFT is a unique thing that has some value or is worth nothing The value is in ETH or some other cryptos Basically it is not some currency itself I appreciate the effort but wanted to point out while looking at the first few points,0,1,0,1,0
gtA singer make one song and sell it to me in lets say 1 and put in the contract that each time that song is resold the singer gets 80 of the profit and 20 goes to the seller I dont understand how this works Does this mean the same instance of this song is resold or a copy? If its a copy how do you maintain uniqueness or the original status a NFT provides? Right know a song exists in milions of copies how would each copy of the song be unique just through its history of owners?,0,1,0,1,0
Depends on how the DAO is set and the NFTs too you dont need to make them all unique you can set and standard price range for common songs but unique copies of it for example extended editions or preownedsigned by the artist itself can be set as unique and have a different price range or even open price range Each contract can vary in the percentages for example 20 for the owners and 80 for the community All those are examples The possibilities are not set in stone thats why is so important to check in each project fundamentals and structure before buying ,0,0,0,1,0

Thank you so much it was very informative! I have some questions if you dont mind asking How would these NFTs be used as currency if each individual is unique and nonfungible? How would one NFT to another NFT be traded? Also I wonder how it would serve as currency if it has high implied volatility,0,1,0,1,0
NFT are nothing else but value Value can be traded towards similar value or trough an extra step such as selling or trading for currency Same way as you have jewelry if is beautiful and desired great fundamentals will have great value you can trade it or sell it trough supply and demand Work as primitive as truce before currency and dollar existed thats how humans traded If you have an asset with similar or equal value you can trade it The key in here is knowing that you have value And value asset is the mom and dad of currency currency its just the middle man to trade,1,0,0,1,0
Thank you for the clarification! What I am wondering now is how would value of different NFTs be evaluated fairly when it comes to NFT being used as a currency?

There are other models in which you can do 70 to the singer 20 for the reseller and burn 10 of the albums with that extra 10 of money to reduce the amount of supply of copies and making it more exclusive Increasing the amount of sales Im probably retarded but exclusivity over time or after many sales of the album seems off If an album gets a lot of resales it would delete the album from the album holders right?,0,1,0,0,1
You are buying ownership It will burn only the copies that are not sold the copies owned already cannot be deleted because belongs to the buyer So the burn only gonna be to the portion that is not sold to shrink and add value to the album holders overtime Thats just a model you might as well dont burn too and the project will be as good its just a way to skin a cat ,0,0,0,1,0
Until there is a decentralized enforcement Which is basically just another DAO Justice system? A judge and a few people as jury? Is that true democracy?

Well its explained in the first couple of sentences Its money like the dollars you have in your bank Simple as that Thats what an NFT is If you dont understand money its ok you will still gonna use it eventually So it will be adopted because its very intuitive,1,0,0,1,0
I honestly need an even more basic explanation than that I know what a dollar is and what represents it or what it represents I know its a green piece of paper or four quarter coins I know this is printed or minted by a government and used for trade and I know roughly its value and what I can trade it for a can of Coke if Im lucky or a bottle of water I know its supposed to be valuable because it is backed by an equivalent amount of something rare gold or silver but that at this point its basically a promise from the US government that it does have value either from the labor hours required to get one or the value that labor creates or as a representation of debt this promise can be verified A dollar is analog format I dont know any of this about an NFT other than it is digital rather than analog which makes it harder for me to understand I dont know what it is in a literal sense and I dont know how it is stored or where what gives it value if any or how to get one keep one or use one My understanding is that it isnt money at all because money is fungible you can exchange any one dollar for another and they are equal in value and use interchangeable However NFT are each unique nonfungible but beyond that so what? Is it just a unhackable digital certificate of authenticity? It it the digital item itself? Is it both? Neither?,0,1,0,1,0

So at start it has the same value because the copies are identical and then during their life one copy can increase in value due to its owning history by a famous person for example? So the current nft collections lets say the crypto punks each punk has a value which differs due to its traits which are differences in its apperance But if i mint a collection of exactly the same punk with no visual difference the only difference would be the unique token address I still dont understand why one punk of a collection constisting of 10000 exactly the same punks would have any value,0,1,0,1,0

No PoW rewards miners that solve a very complecated math problem Bigly computers are needed for this With PoS there is no math probelm and therefore no competiton between miners to solve them So to answer your question the costs are much lower because there is no need for the hardware for massive mining operations and electricity to use them In order to take over a PoW network you need at least 51 of the computers Expensive and unlikely but possible In order to take over a PoS network you need at least 51 of the supply of a coin on that chain Also still possible though much more expensive and much less likely PoS FTW,0,1,0,1,0
Decentralized will move away from politics Thats also a part of their wealth exploit to manipulate commodities and energy markets Technology will solve the problem And L2 definitely consumes lot less energy than anything else I think you might be confusing L1 energy usage with off chain L2 transactions The difference is energy usage is actually 100x less,0,1,0,1,0

Wanted to better understand what is the value underlying a DAO token,0,0,0,1,0
A DAO is essentially an online coop they have a shared mission they have a shared treasury of assets they govern the use of their treasury assets using a decentralized signaling tool such as a governance token or NFT Generally the value of a governance token is related to the protocol it governs For example If a protocol has a treasury with millions of dollars worth of crypto in it and that treasury is governed using a token The token would have an underlying value related to the value of that treasury If a person could acquire enough of the governance tokens they could successfully governance attack the protocol by putting forward a proposal to liquidate the treasury and using their tokens to pass the vote If the cost of the voting asset needed is less then the amount that can be extracted its a profitable exploit The token should therefore have a floor value relative to the treasury it backs,0,1,0,1,0
It is important to note that DAOs have a long history in finance as what basically boiled down to community funded insurance programs in the early periods of popularity In short communities used to pool funds in order to pay for having specialists come and perform work for the community eg doctors and dentists This history is important because we actually have a longstanding legal framework for exactly how they are formed and function despite crypto being new This lets us use historical tools for evaluating utility value quality and illegal activity done under the guise of titling oneself as a DAO Its not some new creation or catchall term that can be used loosely,0,0,0,1,0
Have been going deep into DAOs lately and it really just looks like a way to get crowdsourced funding for a project with voting rights determined by how many tokens of the DAO you hold aka buyin and all of this is executed by a smart contract but still there is a centralised decision maker who then needs to implement said decisions Its really just like Crowdfunder but the people who donate money to the projects initiatives buying tokens get a say in what happens next Thats pretty much the crux of it isnt it? I havent seen a DAO represent itself in a convincing way yet Its basically be part of this community or we are a managed fund that invests in web3 startups but literally nothing is explained in concrete terms Seems so vague as to be not taken seriously most of the time Anyone got any insights? The only few DAOs Ive seen that look good are already run and backed by milliondollar businesses who hold most of the tokens and therefore voting rights so doesnt that actually skew more towards centralised decision making anyway? And anyone else chipping in tokens is justdonating funds?,0,1,0,1,1
Great explanation! I love the DAO format specially as it can really make the community tighter and more engaged! The successes of the ones like Maker DAO inspired the success of others such Optimism Dia or the recently hyped Arbitrum!,1,0,0,1,0
I call this the DAOlemma In order to get started you need a strong core group of driven individuals To become a DAO those individuals must let go of all of that control It is not at all obvious how that transition should work or how the DAO can maintain the vision and drive which created it,0,1,0,0,1
Currently the healthiest examples of DAOs besides Ethereum would be Maker and Compound Uniswap and AAVE technically BTC is also a DAO but it would be understandable for people to be completely unaware of that Anyway maybe study the governance of those organizations to get a better idea how to explain for yourself how a DAO functions Just to explain what it is really doesnt do justice to the complication In short a DAO is simply one token one vote and their purpose is governance in reality what happens is certain VC or foundation developers end up with a massive amount of centralized power,0,1,0,1,0

They dont usually give up control from what I e seen They just bring more people in who vote but the whales and early adopters still run the system,0,1,0,0,1

One of the best examples of this is Shapeshift They were a sort of centralized company with employees but when regulations starting cracking down they moved to a DAO to keep the platform available Most people starting a DAO from scratch miss the fact that they sort of need to prove themselves first for it to be an effective DAO I think the more we find people like Erik Vorhees who can build a strong platform and transition it to a DAO the more well see effective leadership at this level,1,0,0,1,0
What im talking about is PoS governance but can be related to some DAOs in principle People who are voting usually can not code but can express their views before and during signaling proposals In code upgrades which usually needs another proposal thus voting But reality differs in case of emergency For example an important security can be pushed silently on accordance with validators I mean its probably a healthier choice,0,0,0,1,1
DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization Its like a special type of group where everyone whos part of it can vote and make decisions together but instead of having one person in charge the decisions are made by a computer program called a smart contract The smart contract makes sure that everything is fair and transparent and everyone in the group can see whats happening and how decisions are being made People can join a DAO and help make decisions about things like how to spend money or what projects to work on and because its decentralized it means that no one person or group has all the power everyone has a say!,1,0,0,1,0

Is it better to give the same money to the Bitcoin miners? That reasons is very flawed In delegated PoS you never lose the inflation as its reverted back to you through staking rewards In PoW miners capture all the inflation And its more secure as PoS as its much more difficult to hijack There have been former PoW that were attacked including pneumonia of them in the current top25 Im not aware of a single PoS one,0,1,0,1,0
Miners are your security budget They secure the network with a massive wall of energy To attack the network you need to expend 51 of the miners energy Secondarily When we pay the miners we have real companies in the physical world with legal departments lobbying etc they have a presence in Washington or around the world and fight for bitcoins interest When you have PoS thats like saying lets take our security budget and pay it to ourselves,0,1,0,0,1
The security budget is wasted in PoW Its much easier to obtain 50 of the hash for 1 hour once that to ever get 33 of the stake in a PoS Thats why it already happened in medium size PoW coins but never in PoS And it will happen in Bitcoin in the future because the security budget gets halved every 4 years China could invest 2 billions to fuck up bitcoin and do much harm to the West,0,1,0,0,1

As I said the problem is the halvings The security budget will be zero from mining rewards The fees arent enough to pay for the security We dont know if it will take 3 months 4 years or 12 years but eventually it will become vulnerable Actually its already vulnerable If China cared enough they could easily hack the hashrate A few billions to destroy a trillion asset held mostly by people in the West Sounds like an easy opportunity,0,1,0,0,1
Its literally The Rich get richer for doing nothing Crypto Edition Which also means that you basically give up control of your coin to exchanges and Rich folks with money to park on your chain There was a huge push a couple years back to make Dogecoin Proof of Stake and Im so glad that the community resisted and really the people behind it couldnt get their shit together Dogecoin is a functioning Digital Currency and nothing kills a currency like adding the friction of any money you spend is literally robbing future you of free funds On the bright side anyone who really wants a PoS version of Dogecoin can go and resurrect Dogecoin Dark Ha history lesson! and have at it,0,1,1,0,0
Ethereum miners literally tried to bomb the network for their own interests with the POS switch POS and POW is the same shit The only difference is that POS stakers will lose way more than POW miners if the network collapses as they have locked a big chunk of the stake so they have way more incentive to keep it live Meanwhile miners can bomb the network and move to other coin to mine it All this wasting energy and resources Getting rid of miners what the best thing ethereum could do the miners really showed their true colors,0,1,1,0,0
Thats why you definitely dont give them more power The messed up part about proof of stake is that once those ticks are latched onto your chain theres no incentive for them to leave Free money forever that only accumulates which you can invest in having more control So they get the majority of the staking rewards and votes and get to decide the future direction of the network essentially forever For free Now imagine if they get majority stakes on a few different PoS networks? Or if theyre really playing the long game all of the major ones? Thats a lot of free money and control,0,1,0,0,1

Not as easily as youd think because of SHA256 vs Scrypt And even then they can get chased off of those chains or face pressurecompetition due to things like technology changes energy efficiency changes lawsregulations etc Once you have a majority staking position you have zero incentive to leave You set and forget your money likely reinvest your staking rewards to further entrench your position and you basically own that coin Plus really theres Bitcoin and DogecoinLitecoin as the only real viable PoW networks left,0,1,0,0,1

Because DAOs are bullshit The real reason why DAOs are made is to make their tokens not fall under a security They will say its a utility token because it is used in governance therefore its not a security Its a fucking sham Governance voting is a sham because the team owns all the voting power Additionally there is no forced mechanism to force them to actually implement the vote such as they can do a half ass implementation Finally owning a token does not mean you have a share and ownership of the protocol which is a sham These DAOs have control of all the tokens and additionally their own shares I laugh my ass off when I see these DAOs having CEOs ,0,1,1,0,0

Bitcoin is the only decentralized autonomous organization that works Period And the reason is simple There was no initial buy in for the token They were free Members simply wanted to participate in an interesting cryptographic game A proof of concept Except this was no concept It was the real thing Any project offering free tokens after Bitcoins inception1 cannot be taken seriously Heres why The new network asks will you use your computing power toward my network? And any sane user says Sorry it sounds interesting but Im more incentivized to use my compute for Bitcoin And now its worth real money Its not just a cryptographic game that has broken through theoretical limits new network says What if I paid you? it thinks a moment Yeah Ill raise capital and assign my network coins to that capital Then when you send compute with my network youll be rewarded with my capital I mean my tokens! Which are worth someone elses capital? Hey this is great idea for a grift is that mic still on? 1 There was quite a large period of time when Bitcoins token was worth nothing 000 and the Pizza event when it became worth something not 000 During this period a competing network could have taken compute share by offering a better system But no such project materialized,0,1,1,0,0

It really depends on how its set up imo Ill give a few examples not to shill them but simply because its things i considered with them before getting involved Hedera The council of big companies is the DAO they then instruct an outside company to make the changes In this case its the company of the founders but the tokens the founder hold give them no voting rights The companies in the DAO do not take profit and are term limited After 2 terms of 3 years 6 in total they are replaced BankSocial While the DAO is weighted on token holdings being a credit union its bound by law to be NON profit and to put members interests first Again these are just examples of the type of set ups i find acceptable for Web decentralization If you have whales controlling the profit they can have you can bet they will do just that,0,1,0,1,0

What is a DAO? Standing for Decentralized Autonomous Organization a DAO is an internetnative blockchainderived investordirected venture capital fund organization managed by all members At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises Mark Cuban called them the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism One important aspect is that all code is opensource This is done with the aim to eliminate human error manipulation and third parties by having an automated crowdsourced process of decisionmaking Unlike a company DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules secured on the digital ledger across the internet hardened against forgery by timestamping and disseminated as a distributed database The DAO is controlled by the members no managers or basses are needed gtBitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol the miners and nodes signal voting through support DAOs need four things really A set of rules A funding token Voting right provisions A clear structure amp roadmap DAOsA traditional corporation Flat hierarchyHierarchical Voting required for any changesChanges demanded from sole party voting may be offered Voting outcome implemented automaticallyTallied internally and outcome handled manually Services handled automatically in a decentralized mannerHuman handling centrally controlled automation prone to error and manipulation All activity transparent and publicActivity private Creation of a DAO Step one create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system Step two sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights Step three deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization The devs have no more influence than any other stakeholder amp#x200B How can I join a DAO? Just invest in their token and boom youve joined The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAOs rules most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals and only typically proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve different percentage majority per DAO specified in the smart contract Whats the point? Where is the need? Are we all not internet native or soon will be? DAOs are internetnative organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies They have and establish a higher level of trust then say the classical corporate hierarchy Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time This solves the economic principleagentdilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned There are charity DAOs ones for NFT investments for funding projects by Black women and nonbinary artists for funding women and nonbinary crypto founders some are exclusive social clubs and others are forprofit business applications Ive even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor gtExamples of DAOs Aragon MakerDAO MKR DAOstack DASH JennyDAO Jelurida SharkDAO DAOhaus RaidGuild Proof Of Humanity Opolis BanklessDAO MolochDAO Downsides of DAOs No organization is perfect decentralized or autonomous or not This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality security and structural issues As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions there is no legal framework One may have heard about The DAO crashing as back in 2016 The DAO was launched on Ethereum and raised 150 million in ETH largest crowdfunding effort at the time but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took 60 million worth of ETH At the time 14 of all circulating ETH was invested in The DAO Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network which became known as Ethereum Classic or ETC Point being if any gaps in the contract framework arent closed before launch it can lead to potential theft and money loss There is no such thing as a fully D amp A organization Depending on governance there are only various levels of decentralization While the network may have independent but equal network actors the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand technolegal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization Future of DAOs Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole they face security and legality issues As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it Its not all bad though Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs with an ecosystems total assets under management AUM of 134 billion Somewhere in some business boardroom people are trying to figure out how to integrate selfdriving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers You order an Uber and it comes no company just code,0,1,0,1,0
Really interesting! I dont think I fully understand however If anyone has time to answer my questions please! So a DAO is basically like an organization owning the coin of an organization is similar to owning stock in a traditional organization? To me it seems the main difference is as stockholder you have more power in a DAO as opposed to a traditional org as there isnt senior management making decisions? Is it possible for DAOs to replace traditional organizations?

Well with my dad specifically hes open minded enough to not condemn it outright when I explain what crypto is and what different ones do but the most skepticism revolves around the idea of digital gold and then how a blockchain payment system is superior to the traditional system Although thats provided some eye opening opportunities because like a lot of people I dont think hed ever considered that golds only valuable outside of practical applications in electronic manufacturing etc because we agree it is or that fiats only valuable because someone says it is or when you move digital fiat around its not really moving at all and the whole things just a system of IOUs So Im slowly making progress on the skepticism on that front lol but the potential utility of smart contracts like settling the process of buying a house in minutes or seconds instead of months or having wages pay out through a smart contract so that you can get paid for your work that day as soon as you punch out or basically being a programming platform like an operating system that other people can build any application imaginable on that kind of things a lot easier to understand the value of But its basically company but instead of a boardroom and executives complicating things its like if shareholders in a company voted on decisions directly and the people who work there simply carry out whatever is democratically decided to be the companys goals is a hell of a lot easier to explain and understand than smart contracts lol especially for someone whos worked in an office for decades and knows what dealing with inefficient executive leadership in a company is like,0,1,0,1,0

Ive looked into Olympus still trying to figure out how it works but staking APY is crazy big like 7000,1,0,0,1,0
The APY is in their native coin which is inflationary As in they can give such high APY because they make new coins to give to everyone at every epoche and all existing coins get diluted The idea is that as long as enough people are staking for a long time and enough people are buying in either new people or just investing more then the increase in cost from more buyers should outweigh the inflation from minting new coins Well some are minted some are released depends on the DOA So their native coin may drop from 1000 to 500 over a year but the APY was high enough that people still make money when they sell Eventually it will drop to 1 where they start to burn coins so it never drops below,0,1,0,0,1
Im invested in the only Olympus fork on Solana called InvictusDAO I think of it this way as the market cap rises rather than your coin value rising youre given more coins through staking This encourages long term staking The protocol is supposed to keep the coin price stable in the long term which allows for the high APY Im bullish on the idea OlympusDAO OHM has a coin price similar to its opening price 8m ago but if you invested 600 1 OHM youd have roughly something like 25k 41ish OHM today I think an innovative coin achieving 41x inside a year isnt that crazy so the APYs really doesnt tell the whole story,1,0,0,1,0

One big problem in the crypto space voting and DAOs is the ageold problem with pure democracies Through history people have always been mostly inclined to look at short term benefits over long term when it comes to group voting dynamics possibly largely due to lack of information education that would enable them to craft a big picture perspective People would vote for the candy man who gives away free cash rather than the doctor who tells them they have diabetes and prescribes horrible tasting but necessary medicine This is the reason why we do have layers in government because it enables people to place their trust in others to make better and more informed decisions for them and they are the agents of the people This is one of the big things that I havent seen crypto address The pendulum is too far in the other direction in this sphere,0,1,0,0,1

From what Ive seen often its a dev team trying to cater to the votes of the DAO but the dev team retains all the power and often whatever resources the DAO has There is basically zero recourse if they scam everyone Corporations have regulations and the Feds go after to them if they break certain rules Also DAOs arent all open and everything they do is visible Often just the votes are visible Communication between the insiders isnt public Like the team that runs the DAO I think DAOs need a lot more work and I personally would caution anyone from thinking theyre some open inherently transparentpublic organization Thats the ideal but right now its mostly just the votes that are transparent and who has the most voting power,0,1,0,0,1

Great post but I dont think your downsides is clear enough so Ive reworded part of it If youre not confident enough to review the DAO code yourself you have to put your trust in the fact that its both a programmed to do what you think it does and b is free from bugs or exploits that will let people steal money from it This is extremely difficult to do even for people who write software normally,0,1,0,0,1

Giving value to your time For instance wayyy to many people invested a lot of time in LoL and now have an insane collection of skins and other stuff And they have the issue that they are so invested into the game that they dont want to try others or that if they leave the game when they do all that time would have been for mostly nothing So the one and only thing that we found that NFTs solve is converting that time into money If the player wants to leave a game they can essentially sell everything and start a new one and they could even use those earnings to have a head start on the new game,1,1,0,0,0
gtSo the one and only thing that we found that NFTs solve is converting that time into money no they dont if a game wanted you to be able to transfer ownership of your account or items they could enable that functionality without having to go through the hassle and absurd cost of spinning up a blockchain why do people think NFTblockchain technology is something that can exist without full support of the game company accepting it? every single NFT idea has to exist in the context that if a game company actively wanted to provide functionality that a hypothetical blockchain or NFT would supposedly provide you have to consider why they wouldnt want to use something much cheaper and simpler than a blockchain,0,1,1,0,0
You are trying to propose a different solution instead and its not wrong but thats not the point Im just answering the question with the actual solution that NFTs brought thats it And sure there could be insanely better solutions that the Blockchain and so on which is why I didnt mention the whole ownership idea because we dont think thats a benefit The whole point is that you play a lot and then you sell all the stuff you get for real money And of course that sounds great The current solution at the moment for it are NFTs and thats terrible but its a correct answer to the question Now in the perfect world any company would just let you to sell your skins for real money and Valve for example is so close to that idea with the Steam Market they allow to convert you time into money Steam Money so close to the real thing,0,1,1,1,0
Im seeing a lot of folks bring up stuff like deeds and proof of ownership but what happens if you forget your wallet password? What happens if someone dies and the government needs to transfer ownership of a house? NFTs dont really handle this well The nonbullshit use case for NFTs and the entire principle behind the creation of crypto is applications in Trustless Systems replacing a central authority with a publicly verifiable hardtofake ledger The thing is almost nobody wants to make or use a trustless system As a game developer Im not here to make sure users dont have to trust game developers Im just trying to make a good product and engage in trustworthy market practices deliver on my promises stuff like that The government definitely doesnt want to make a trustless system they want people to trust the government If the government paperwork starts to disagree with the NFT I guarantee any government utilization will throw out the NFT and replace it with a new one dropping the main strength NFTs bring to the table Even cryptobros dont seem to actually want a trustless system As soon as you see someone scam people out of their NFTs they call for openocean to get them back or shut down trading of the stolen assets they prefer the centralized trusted system over the trustless nature of NFTs So if I truly wanted to make something that was completely out of my hands once it was produced and I could fit the entire specification of the thing inside the NFT itself no references to a jpeg or a game asset otherwise its just a trustless receipt to a trustbased system then I would acknowledge that an NFT would be an applicable solution to my technical problems I dont think many things call for that and I think nothing in game development calls for that Everything else can be done better without NFTs,0,1,0,0,1

He brings up really good points that I also never thought of! One of the stupidest things about NFTs to me which is that they seek to destroy the one huge advantage digital art has over physical art It can be copied infinitely Why the fuck would people want to destroy that and create a way shittier digital version of that lol? The only reason is speculative investment If something exists solely for speculative investment it is a big pile of bullshit,0,1,1,0,0

1 most of the art nfts out there are not minted by the artists but scammers People buying them dont give a shit about the artists Its just a speculative investment The art isnt the thing thats worth shit the nft is 2 art based nfts have gone out of fashion as the only ones that made money were meme images 3 the vast majority of nft now are randomly generated collage images based on videogame micro transaction style loot tables that allow for rare items even though each one is supposed to be unique anyway And the minters are the people being scammed Theres no need for the con artists to even invest in their scam now All the risk is on the people who buy in and then the creators just dump their coin into some exchange and vanish 4 the stuff they sell people on like royalties are things that have to be supported by the chain and the transaction platform so even if you have a smart contract that dictates royalty payments you can easily get around it by using an exchange that doesnt allow for royalty payments 5 web3isgoinggreatcom,0,1,1,0,1
Wouldnt it be easier to do that by taking a highquality original and getting a physical print from a nice store? Most artists release a scaled down version for public consumption so with this approach you can ensure you have a higher quality print than most Its pretty easy to say I have an original piece signed and number by the author when you have both the physical object and maybe even VOD of the artist signing and number the piece on a stream,0,1,0,0,0

I think digital ownership of an item is a legit thing to offer if you just think of it as a way to pay for something you like in a way that directly benefits the creator Its like vinyl records they dont really provide any real added utility over just streaming a song but I know people who dont even have a record player who own vinyl because they think its a cool thing to buy to support an artist they like Thats not much of a functional use case but I think its a valid reason for their existence I personally wouldnt buy an NFT for that purpose but it would make sense to me if someone wanted to as long as its for their own satisfaction and they dont get hung up on it it people have copies Blender Guru is doing an NFT donut series I can totally imagine someone throwing some money at that if they feel he deserves to be rewarded for all the hard work he has put in helping people learn 3D modeling Just an example,1,0,0,1,0
At least with vinyl there is an inherent difference to streaming a songanalog vs digital And as much as you do or dont believe in audiophiles ability to tell the difference there IS a difference as digital is still technically an approximation no matter how precise That difference can give some value to the vinyl compared to the digital file With an NFT theres literally no difference just a receipt taped to the side that says owned by XXX,0,1,0,0,0

I see a huge problem with NFTs mainly because as others have mentioned its about proof of ownership and all that except you need some sort of centralized authority to actually enforce the ownership in some way Its like with Twitter introducing the ability to have people use NFTs as profile pictures except Twitter doesnt really do anything to prevent others from using your picture so it isnt exactly useful in any way The moment you have Twitter or any company or a game company stepping in to lay down laws it becomes a situation where theres a central authority deciding who is the rightful owner of what and its just a mess Sure everyone has their digital receipts but unless someone is actually there to enforce the ownership then it doesnt really matter Oh you own a lazy monkey jpeg? Cool you want to use it exclusively as your profile picture? Okay Now explain how any company can really enforce that without being the arbiter of monkeys,0,1,0,0,1

And the NFT model offers no advantages over the current Account Settings in a database model,0,1,1,0,0
In theory it doesnt have to be Using a really basic example if we said that the asset was a png file with some metadata about its use this would let any game support the metadata and the texture in whatever way makes sense for the game It also means that I can sell that to anyone else for them to use in their game and neither of us need to rely on steam as an example for a marketplace or for verification If Im banned from steam I can still use my asset on other platforms The problem here is 1 these NFTs need to actually be content and not urls otherwise its a waste of time because theres no guarantee that the URL contains the same thing at a later point and 2 someone needs to mint the NFT in the first place If you let anyone mint anything then it will ruin any sort of cosmetic economy and likely have a very negative effect on the overall game from an artistic directive Youll end up with clashing styles inappropriate content etc On the other hand if you restrict minting of content to the developers well weve just gone full circle,0,1,0,0,1
I feel like nobody has ever stopped to think that why would I want to officially own things on the internet? In video games this gets even more nonsensical We already have items in video games you technically own The only problem is that its simple and effective which goes entirely against the basic premise of Blockchain technology Also places such as Steam Marketplace exist where you can trade these items if the game allows,0,1,1,0,0
For the first one I can see a certain appeal with how memes propagate images that the meme creators dont own See the Bad Luck Brian guy who has no ownership of the picture of himself thats spread across the internet without his consent Or see artists like Shen and Sarah Scribbles whose comics are frequently edited and shared without attribution Even people who make viral tweets that get screencapped and then shared with the original user cropped off So I can see someone whos gone viral wanting some ownership over that I think thats actually a reasonable answer to the why question Of course the problem is determining what owning it actually means That you can charge people who use it? CampD people who use it without your permission? But thats just copyright law right? But obviously this is a problem NFTs dont solve Bad Luck Brian bought the NFT for Bad Luck Brian and I still said he has no ownership and not that he had no ownership because that NFT he bought is functionally useless,0,1,0,0,1

I guess in theory if you had something along the lines of a digital collectable card game with widely agreed upon rules think Magic The Gathering then if all your cards were NFTs and the 1st party game was nolonger supported a 3rd party could reimplement the game using the same NFTs so you would be able to carry on using your cards But of course MTG is seen by some to be a predatory scam itself so maybe thats still not a good use,0,1,0,1,0

Just about any actual use for them is easily replaced withinsystem A common example touted early on was that you could buy a VIP status or membership to a club and get an NFT to represent that Then you could sell it to someone else if you want Problem is if they wanted to the company could just Do that? They can just allow membership to be transferable within their site Its not like that NFT has ANY value outside of their club so having it noncentralized is meaningless Any scenario where an outside party wants to know about the membership or something that club most likely would see it as worthwhile to have an API the 3rd party can just query That said I can see some potential down the line use cases If true ready player one games start existing some form of protection on user created content would be necessary Additionally it would be very beneficial to all games to allow player generated stuff to transfer between games especially if its just as simple as a model Here something with similar benefits to an NFT would be good Problem is you STILL wouldnt want it bound to crypto If I had to guess itd be a significantly more isolated system where the game companies might set up a chain that only they manage Players wouldnt have direct access because they dont need it Theyd just give their ID which would be associated to whats currently a wallet to the game they want to play and itd look in its system to see whats up Even then it wouldnt have to have the immutability of a traditional Blockchain and there are probably simpler solutions If someone can think of a scenario where current NFTs actually do have a real use case beyond making money and losing money I would love to know,0,1,0,0,1
The only thing Blockchain in general gives you is decentralisation In general its opposite of what you want asa game dev you want control over your games In theory you could make games with verifiable online interactions without servers with that but its very difficult to think of an actual use case It could be viable if you wanted to make an online game with content that is opposed by some country government and they are likely to take down your servers But thats about it I think,0,1,0,0,1
Seeing a lot of people suggest using it to make digital games resellable and just want to point out some problems there NFTblockchain tech is not needed to make such a system Steam could easily be retooled to let you make games you own into tradeable items that others could redeem for the game They even used to let you buy games as inventory items except they stopped when people were abusing regional pricing Theyre not going to do that as theres nothing to gain and a lot to lose implementing such a system Theyd firstly have to pay money to make the system allow games to be tradeable And then theyd just lose more money since there is absolutely NO reason to buy a new digital copy of a game when a used one functions the same and is cheaper The only difference is some random middleman gets a bulk of the sale and not the developers that actually spent money making that game Saying but devs could get a cut of those sales Why would they want if we used Steam Marketplace rates as an example 10 of a sale thats lower than MSRP when they could just have the game sold at MSRP and get 70 or more of the sale? It would also make temporary sales nonexistent since youre competing with people who can just drop the price lower than your Sale Price again And before someone brings up that the used game market didnt kill video game companies big AAA companies arent the ones going to be heavily impacted by such a system Its going to be smallerindie dev companies that get screwed by such a system Even some of the very successful indie titles out there still end up making not enough money to justify a games development cost,0,1,0,0,1
So I am not a fan of NFTs and think theyre pretty useless in gaming overall as usually the game is single player or has a centralized server Even the cool idea of selling items between games with NFTs requires each game to accept those NFTs as valid items which couldve been accomplished just as easily with a shared database in fact usually you need the shared database anyways as NFTs cant store much data The one valid use case I can think of is a game where you can play with people offline and then when you reconnect to the centralized server have blockchain proof of what occurred while you were offline a receipt of actionstradeskills that occurred Back in college in the infancy of blockchain one of my professors had a bus game idea where players would play on a bus wifi together busses in our college town at the time had wifi on board but usually no access to the internet and then actions they did on the bus would be confirmed via blockchain But lets be real especially with cellphones how often do you really not have access to the internet? In short if the game is singleplayer no use for blockchain If the game is multiplayer but you have access to the internet no use for blockchain you can trust the game server Only in a situation where you need to make actions outside a trusted authority but then provide proof to the trusted authority those actions occurred does it have any value,0,1,0,0,1

One possibility Id actually legitimately consider implementing would be to handle license reselling Youre still minting licenses as usual licenses are still checked as usual when say uploading highscores or filing support tickets lets keep DRM out of this but owners do not need to communicate with the license authority to sell their license Thing is According to EU law licenses have to be resealable at least for offtheshelf that is not bespoke software Valve is currently fighting a lengthy court battle to get around that but theyre going to lose sooner than later Both as a gamedev and player I wouldnt want licenses to be tied to a specific market place though and I dont want to run my own either A server being able to answer here have a look at this NFT did you mint that OTOH sounds perfectly sensible That way market places can assure that what theyre allowing people to trade is indeed a license for my game and not some random bits whereas I get assured that the thing cant be copied,0,1,0,1,0

Every good thing someone say about NFTs in games you can think of several downsides of that thing,0,1,0,0,1
Disclaimer I suspect theres still lots I dont understand about NFTs and Blockchain because of how convoluted they are and say based on what I can understand that NFTs are basically nonlegally binding receiptspointers to things that can actually be valuable In other words when you buy an NFT you own the receiptpointer but that doesnt give you ownership to the thing the NFT is pointing to So even if the NFT is minted by the owner of the thing the NFT is pointing to and thats not always going to be the case but for the sake of this topic lets assume its minted in good faith theres no legal recourse for the buyer if the studio decided to arbitrarily not recognize the buyer as the owner of the piece of game asset that the NFT is pointing to This would be like funding a games kickstarter getting the founders package and no mechanism in place to ensure that the studio honors their word and puts your name up as a founder when the game releases In short no I dont think theres a nonbullshit use case for NFTs based on the fact that even if all parties were to act in good faith theres nothing legally binding or enforceable concerning ownership,0,1,0,0,1
As a quick addition you touch upon a hilarious problem that NFTs also have They are pointers essentially URLs The majority of the time they arent stored in something like an IPFS but instead a standard location They are just as vulnerable to link rot as anything else In fact a major problem thats happened is pointing an NFT to a virus that will dump your wallet into a target account when opened because you can point that URL to anything I can give you a hand grenade then pull the pin without you having any say in the matter You cant get rid of the bomb easily because doing so requires actually checking the NFT You just have to be sure to never click the empty wallet icon that is now front and center on your dashboard Its especially bad because it can look like anything it wants and users will naturally click the random new item that popped up without them knowing,0,1,0,0,1
The only thing Ive heard about that doesnt scream snake oil are private blockchains for huge manufacturing companies tracking parts Where tokens hold no value and its really more about data being extremely hard to manipulate once its been submitted Meaning the companies who contribute parts and employees have a harder time lying For games the only use case I see is circumventing anti gambling regulations or other laws,0,1,0,0,1
Private Blockchains are kind of pointless thoo The whole point of a blockchain is to track information without having to trust a central authority In your described case a database behind a api that doesnt allow deleting or editing would do everything a blockchain could And is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper Finally a blockchain is just a appendonly database The information stored in it can easily be misinput or manipulated The blockchain is not allknowing and doesnt actually know where a part is at all So for private applications by a single authority blockchains would serve literally no purpose and waste electricity and cause annoyances with private keys And in the end you dont even get the one benefit blockchain actually implements Trustlessness Ah and everyone will know where all your parts are at all times What? They shouldnt,0,1,1,0,0
Ive been freelancing on other stuff for big car manufacturers who are interested in it You cant think of it the same way as Bitcoin or Ethereum or anything of the sort Yes an API driven database permission system with syncing across locations and all that can fulfill the same purpose But Ive been told that they run their tests less labor intensive and at comparable cost The key difference is that with blockchain they had a buzz word large enough to convince management to invest an appropriate sum into developing such a system Its changing from a fractured system with plenty of information loss and human error during data processing into a properly automated and digital one It doesnt fix misalignment of real world data vs input data at all But they have full control over all devices Meaning most people just get scanners Not an interface to insert data Still not fixing all those issues but at least fixing communication issues along the way Nor would a database though This complaint is valid when talking about assigning arbitrary real world value to chains But when a company just replaces databases or fking paper bookkeeping I shit you not with a blockchain fulfilling similar purposes then this flaw has no real impact Its not new or exists because of the tech And not everyone has chain access either Like the intranet is not built for arbitrary data access The chain isnt publicly accessible but not accessible internally from just anywhere either Its certainly not a perfect system Im sure they find plenty of issues But its apparently slightly better in some areas slightly worse in others While having the significant advantage of actually existing The basic tech is similar But all the settings are turned in the opposite direction than public blockchains Because it doesnt have to worry about the kinds of attacks that gets public chains in trouble,0,1,0,1,0
Absolutely right Its not a breakthrough at all Thats why I brought up the example Its used as a tool that does a thing About as disruptive as mysql vs mongoDB Similar result different flavor Because its fully controlled it has good enough speed Like youre talking about differences of milliseconds No one cares about that in the context of storing this kind of real world data thats only relevant for real world info Thats only relevant for entirely digital processes with no interface to real world processes or assets Eg finance stock markets Deployment is trivial out of the box redundancy is given by default and scale too is not a problem Remember its just about company internal processes They can do millions of operations per second and can scale up at any time again transaction security is not important They can increase block sizes on demand within a day,0,1,0,0,0
Thats cool and all but Ive implemented similar systems in several other sectors and I dont think its much harder to set up an databasemessage queue with an API gateway in front of it which enables appendonly In fact with a modern cloud provider and the relaxed latency requirements youve mentioned this is relatively trivial and I reckon ends up being cheaper to both develop and operate than the blockchain based system Keep in mind how much stuff youll get for free this way once the data is in a database your BI people will be able to start querying that stuff in tableau no problem will be able to create webbased dashboards that automatically refresh alert on KPIs connect it to fraud detection solutions With a blockchain based system youll have to build connectors for all this yourself at far greater expense I dont see how what theyve built has any technical advantages and hence why it wouldnt be considered pure tech debt by the time the hype has simmered down since its selfhosted has far more complex underlying technologies far more underlying knobs and switches to tune you mention blocksize  and I bet the client is more complex too and maintaining client apps can be a nasty cost center,0,1,0,0,1
gtPrivate Blockchains are kind of pointless thoo There are plenty of usecases for private DLT I dont like the word Blockchain it implies certain technologies in the frenemy space For instance I have worked in the energy sector where message systems are maintained individually and synchronized in each company for transferring client contractsinformation consumed energy values etc Companies dont trust each other to give someone centralized power to maintain such system Maintenance of such backbone was a nightmare especially the integrity of data Its inherently a distributed system by necessity but without having a BFT consensus to maintain integrity between frenemy A well established and stable DLT platform would definitely solve our problems at that moment I dont know the state of it anymore dont work in the field anymore But theres definitely usecases out there So please dont dismiss the technology as a whole just because NFTs are bullshit,0,1,0,1,0

They can add another dimension your ingame items and economy by making items collectible in the same way physical items are Not being tied to the functionality or longevity of your actual game If I make or play a game then even long after its inevitably abandoned and servers are shut down people can still own and trade the receipts of items from that game I think thats simply cool even if these items will have no utility Many people are naturally drawn to collecting and they often collect things that no longer have any utility like old coins or stamps,1,0,0,1,0

A guy from a games publisher came to give a talk at our university he was more on the business side of things than development He briefly mentioned NFTs and asked what our opinion was of them show of hands needless to say no one in the audience thought they were any good He didnt go in depth because it wasnt the focus of the talk but he seemed to believe NFTs would allow for cross platform ownership of a game I agree that this would be cool but why would any console support it? What incentive do they have? Why do we even need NFTs for this? Cant any prospective platform make a deal with valve and let me enter my steam credentials instead?

Theres nothing NFTs can provide that doesnt already exist Proof of Ownership? We call those Titles and Copyrights Exchange for value? We call that Currency Blockchain? We call those Ledgers Im against NFTs because they provide the end user with no actual benefits that didnt already exist in other forms and they tend to benefit only the people pushing them down everyone elses throats all while harming the environment severely Have you seen how much powerenergy is required to mint a single NFT? Its not pretty As long as we as a species arent using clean sources to provide that energy were overworking the planet and hurting it which is unsustainable for our survival But back on NFTs theyre basically a scam Just ask Gabe Newell from Valve Corporation about 50 of all transactions involving cryptocurrencies and by extension NFTs because lets face it its 90 the same crypto crowd pushing Web3 were scam transactions If a 50 scam rate is not any indication Id hate to see a supporters investing habits,0,1,1,0,1
The value of NFTs is only that they are trustless Crypto as a ledger system has uses but not where it intersects with exchangeable value Its potentially a great way to to increase transparency in financial transactions but not as a financial system itself Imagine if in the US for example all political campaign expenditures donations lobbyists etc were on a publicly available hard to fake ledger That could have real value But the point of an NFT specifically is to avoid the centralized tracking and control Imagine a separate possible use case for them Some entity wants to support say a nottechnicallyallied nation in its defense against an invading force But the political ramifications of doing so in a traceable manner would be dire Heres an alternative exchange system that could allow for indirect support while creating ambiguity around the source But as far as games go? Nope I dont think there is a single valid use case that doesnt have immediately better and honestly easier safer scalable ecofriendly etc alternatives,0,1,0,0,1
The big disconnect is people are perceiving and pitching it to do the wrong thing NFTs technically are buckets of executable code but are impermeable once they have been minted They are good at tokenizing keys That can be useful but its an emerging technology If you look at an NFT game and strip away all the blockchain youre usually left with something that could have been replicated without the blockchain That said when were looking at Web 30 and cooperative ownership rather than centralized networks we dont yet know what sort of opportunities could open up as its being developed Is it a scam? Maybe Id consider it a lot more like the collectibles hobby It works pretty much the same way is someone going to want to buy your Mint 98 A Sealed Ocarina of Time in 100 years?

Whilst I fully agree with all the reasons against NFTs and their current state of frustration distrust and uncertaintyIve been fairly interested in them from the perspective of artistry and the benefits to individual artists For an explanation of one good that can come from NFTs and how they will affect the perception and value of art just watch Blender Gurus videos on YouTube specifically Youre Wrong about NFTs here I personally am hoping for some regulation to reduce scams ensure ownership and validate them to build public trust so they can be utilized the way they were intended Im excited to see how they evolve I personally own about 10 NFTs just for fun and to understand the process Theyre worthless junk and I got them all for free But I found them fascinating and am enjoying watching how the technology progresses,1,1,1,1,0

At its core its just a token Even if a game doesnt sell NFTs for money It could still use NFTs to represent in game items This decentralizes your in game items allowing people to theoretically builduse thirdparty apps to manage or trade or do whenever they want with their items Can we accomplish the same thing without NFTs yes Theoretically is decentralizing things good yes,0,1,0,1,0
This is actually something that sounds interesting I built a game about 20 years ago where players could discover recipies and exchange them with each other In my game it was sharing ie you get to keep your copy but in a game where the item only belongs to one player at a time this might work And it would open up the game in the sense of players being able to trade items outside the game right?,1,0,0,1,0
Exactly your recipies exist outside your game on the blockchain Which means your users can do whatever they want with them That is the real value of NFTs your users arent reliant on you the developer to tell them what they can and cant do I believe all the negativity around NFTs currently has to do with all the scams and creators charging insane amounts of money just because its an NFT Take money out of the equation and it can help to find legitimate uses for the technology,1,1,0,1,0

Right but what does this have to do with the blockchain? The blockchain does what few other software achieve rocketing so hard to the right in a quality nonrepudiation distributed ledger that actually running it is EXTREMELY costly and not just in the development of the software but actually using it For every new miner who enters the field the cost of finding the next block to stamp the last unverified block as goodtogo increases Which is what mining essentially does find a unique identifier for the last unidentified block of time usually 10 minutes The blockchain ecosystem as a whole increases in costpertransaction once you connect increasing amounts of transactions to increasing value of the cryptocurrency to more miners trying to get at the miner pool of produced cryptocurrency the fountain from which the well of coins feeds It achieves nonrepudiation which means that you can 9999999999999999999999 guarantee that the sender of some information is provided proof of the transactions delivery and the receiver is provided with proof of the senders identity so neither can later deny having processed that information and everyone who uses the blockchain can prove it This is huge This is fantastic Im not going to lie I was floored when I read up on the concept and actually developed a prototype for a DoD project which duh failed since it was attempting to tie identity to an innately anonymous system more on this later BUT there was a fatal flaw in our understanding of the usecase and cost of using the blockchain for everything I had always been taught that There are no good solutions only solutions built on assumptions and constraints often unsaid that always have a cost also often unsaid amp#x200B The cost of MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE Distributed nonrepudiation Assumptions are things that we believe to be true and which we therefore build into the project plan Constraints are things that we know to be true and which must be accounted for in the plan so that we can work around them In a world where energy was not a concern the blockchain freaking rules But we know it is a concern so this is a constraint In a world where you could absolutely secure ones own digital wallet never lose it and have contingencies where if you die it can be passed on the blockchain freaking rules This is an assumption In a world where humans would never compromise the history of a blockchain there are many blockchain freaking rules This can be fairly said to be an assumption at the time of blockchains conception In a world where humans only use of the technology was to make transactions that didnt take advantage of anonymity and obfuscation to trade funds for harmful means blockchain freaking rules This is a constraint but a softer one since it doesnt necessarily constrain the technology itself but rather how effective the rhetoric is in defending it Difficult to defend blockchain when its been proven to be one of if not the best avenue of trading cash for child pornography money laundering and even and I am not kidding you actual slavery the realreal kind Any group that tries to then tie identity into the system to thus mitigate these transactions runs up against one of blockchains core principles one that is inextricably tied to its functionality nearly infinite wallets nearly infinite anonymity But we have limited amounts of energy limited bandwidth to transport that energy energy that is often reliant on politics and business to maintain that energy longterm environmental costs of using certain types of energy including the production of renewableenergy sources political discussions around using certain types of energy nuclear uncertain futures about certain types of energy fusion and the people who support the blockchain often want to ignore this or skew the facts

Cryptocurrency takes cash out of a generally understood and traceable system Our current banking system which still should be critically scrutinized and criticized dont get me wrong and moves it to a system where smart users can use it to grift people who dont get in on scams early pyramid schemes pay for harmful media support harmful operations and be held largely unaccountable But sure it can be used to trade and display ingame objects across a single or even multiple video games Anyone who tells you different is like those uninformed and wellmeaning opponents of the blockchain But you can literally already do this with regular servers and transactions and companies that can be held more accountable than a distributed system of nerds amp#x200B It has logical use cases and in my opinion

Just to clarify things NFTs are not only to sell and exchange art They are uniquely identified and owned tokens based on this you can imagine a lot of usecase And there is a whole lot of realworld objects that correspond to this description The problem is that the part where people can gamble on it looks like the only one to interest the public During an internship at a company we developed a trucks shipment tracking system based on the Ethereum blockchain Every box in a truck was identified by a unique code and of course a box can only be in one truck at a time gt we used custom made NFTs that identified each box the owner being the truck it is in at a point The interesting part was that to change ownership both trucker had to sign a transaction meaning that they both agreed on the fact that the box had change truck and was in good shape It was working well and had some advantages like providing an history of ownership knowing quite easily who is responsible for a box at a given time  and a lot of defaults we needed to use a private blockchain because these data cannot be public dismissing almost the whole point about blockchain there was a mobile app to sign the transactions if the trucker lostbroke his phone the private key was lost  There is a lot of possibilities with NFTs and the lets buy this hape and resell it twice its price next week because of some hipe is just one of them Some NFTs are not resellable they just identify a unique thing you own and cannot exchange Im not saying NFTs are a good thing in 90 of the case people are just trying to harvest the hipe around the subject but there are usecases wellsuited for it,1,0,0,1,0
gtIm not saying NFTs are a good thing in 90 of the case people are just trying to harvest the hipe around the subject but there are usecases wellsuited for it I have to be honest though the use case you present can be achieved with preexisting technology I see no advantage in using any kind of blockchain for it?

Fully agree with you this is why the said company I was doing my internship in is currently struggling finding clients everybody speak about blockchain but when the discussion shift to ho btw this custom tracking system will cost 6 months of developments nobody want to pay knowing that a 10 a month SAAS will provide the same service They only survive on public investments I love this technology but to be fully honnest with myself I never saw a project where I was like ho damn this could not have been done without a blockchain Im still waiting for someone presenting me a usecase that is 100 impossible without a blockchain I think all the projects we are speaking about are only relevant in a world where blockchain is widely used Its like payment terminals it currently make a whole lot of sense but imagine if everybody was using cash it still would be interessting as a technology but would be useless,0,1,1,1,0

The only usecase I could ever see an NFT used for would be something like digital concert tickets or movie tickets A lot of people used to like collecting and holding on to these as memories The pitfalls here obviously completely outway the practicality of it though storing a physical ticket for an extended period of time has little to no realworld repercussions and the same cant be said about storing that on a blockchain on some server Then you have the issue of losing your password means that you lose access to all of those memories It honestly takes some real mental power and jumping to ever see an upside in NFTs and they are honestly just ways to sucker gullible people into spending their money on nothing of value,0,1,1,0,1

The one usecase that I would love to see with NFTs and games is to make digital games linked to an NFT so that you could transfer that game to another person if you want One thing that is limiting about buying a digital copy of a game is that you cant let your friend borrow the game or sell it again after youre done playing it This could probably be achieved without NFTs within a single ecosystem like Steam or Xbox etc but I dont see that being likely any time soon because they make so much money off of forcing each person to buy a license to the game But if you could truly OWN a digital game and transfer it around like a physical game that would be interesting to me I thought that may be what Gamestop was going to do with NFTs since they also facilitate buying digital games for Xbox but I honestly think the technical complications of such a system is beyond Gamestops capabilities But this is one thing that I see as a problem in need of a solution that can actually be solved by a trustless system like NFTs I think making digital assets within a game NFTs and playtoearn games are simply not that useful or desirable,1,0,0,1,0

The haters are out in force in these comments downvoting anyone trying to give you an answer Sad to see so many goodwilled honest answers being stifled Ill be the first to admit the NFT ecosystem is absolutely infested with scams But the question is if there is ANY nonbs use case And there are such cases The consistent objection to those cases is yea but a regular database is better AGAIN the question was if there is a nonbs use case NOT is there a use case where NFT is the objectively best way to accomplish it The same criticism can be levelled against crypto generally Blockchains are slower and less efficient than a traditional database Thats unobjectionably true But it enabled trustless systems If your game has no need of a trustless system then you have no case for NFT But can you imagine a game which might have such a need? I could The most obvious would be to evade local laws If you want to enable gamblingselling accounts in a jurisdiction which forbids this NFT will enable it in a way that is hard to suppress Oh sorry were we all assuming the use case had to be legal? I didnt see that in the question Some devs and some players may want this Ipso facto its a use case,0,1,0,0,1
So the thing Ive been thinking of that they might be reasonable for is as a way to do software keys Replacing the check this key with a central server before running functionality with check this key on the Blockchain before running It would mean that there could be a secondhand market on digital only products which wouldnt be reliant on a central authority Which is a bad thing if you forget your passwords but it would mean that if the distribution rights for a game vanish into the aether or a company goes under youll still be able to have a way to buy the game without going straight to piracy Right now there are plenty of old PS2 games that couldnt be redistributed due to music licensing But I can still walk into a second hand game store and buy the disk and play it provided I can find one Now this would come with all the negatives of this area too scalping on the secondhand market and enforced artificial scarcity But it would help cut down on some of the FOMO from if I dont buy it during this specific window they may never put it out for sale again Now this isnt to say that any parties involved actually have an interest in doing this Publishers have no economic reason to want to encourage the creation of a secondhand market subject to economic forces when right now they have a functional monopoly on each game So I dont see this happening Maybe as a consumer rights argument being pushed by media companies that want to use it as an excuse for more draconian DRM And if that were the case I think we would lose more than we gain from a legitimate second hand market But I feel like thats at least a nonbullshit use of NFTs Even if it wont happen,0,1,0,1,0
Selling software this way doesnt necessitate a secondhand market If you were motivated to do so I believe you could set up a smart contract in such a way that the token would be nontransferable You could also just add a check into your game that makes sure the token the user holds came directly from an official source Biggest benefit here is you dont have to go through a third party to sell your game or share profits with them You just have to serve an exe and sell a token somewhere,0,0,0,1,0

It lets you store things on the blockchain instead of a database For example instead of a user buying an item in your game and storing ownership of that item in a database you can charge the user money to store it on the blockchain and keep some of that money for yourself,1,0,0,1,0
So what? Whats the advantage over a database?

No not in gaming The only use for a NFT is to maintain a decentralized ownership record Its great for crypto currency titles and records Things that you need to keep track of who owns it and that many different groups would be interested in In gaming you dont have that Nothing is transferable between games You arent going to import your character from League of Legends into Dark Souls The games are simply incompatible and the companies have zero incentive to work together,0,1,0,0,1
We recently had a beta tournament to test our PvP gameplay The first three places received a nontransferrable NFT as recognition of that feat We have of course also use cases for other NFTs but this being one with no monetary value attached to it We also have collectable NFTs that are given away for free in our community for participating in events and contests These can be traded between users but can not be bought from us their collectable status alone and demandsupply makes up the value of these tokens Seven of these have been released so far here is an overview These NFTs and a lot more can be interpreted by us in our games or by other devs if they want to acknowledge them in their games Due to the distributed ledger technology we are using it will also be possible to transfer supported items between different games but thats a bit more complicated to explain here Whats important for us is that all this can be done in the background without the player even knowing about,0,0,0,1,0
NFTs as of now can indeed be used as a proof of ownership over digital goods but not LITERAL digital files like the artwork sound files or models they are being used for now I can see them being used as an antipiracy tool by software companies like adobe and autodesk requiring a NFT license to access their creative suites Ironically the blueprint for this is already infront of us with how boredapes uses their NFTs as access to activities and locales under their brand Even so the barrier to this happening is huge It requires crypto wallets and cryptocurrency to be commonplace which definitely wont be something happening in current year I also doubt it will be seen in a positive light at the moment with the running scams utilizing NFTs Some speculation for the far future if blockchain does eventually find a way to store more than just hashes on the chain its usecase can see exponential growth in places where secure data is needed with NFTs being the data rather than just being claim to the data,0,1,0,1,0

I think its best used as a way to transfer things between ecosystems or let one thing also be another thing elsewhere Like say you bought a special edition of game A so game B lets you have a related thing in game Blizzard used to do this a lot Or in a closed ecosystem like Roblocks you can track who actually has the coveted fedora Question would be how would Activision and Nintendo work such a system? Like theyd have to cooperate on some kind of joint infrastructure and work on maintaining it and having a new account or linking accounts related to either of theirs as a base forming weird entries Totally solveable with current tools just kinda klunky especially if youre not gonna use it more than once Then again NFTs theoretically at least can act in this way as a universalized structure to solve this problem That was my first thought Now what your do with a proof of having thing A giving you B elsewhere used for?

I didnt read all the comments but I have heard of precisely one actual use case for blockchains not NFTs specifically in games When a developer no longer wants to run a game anymore they have to sunset it Currently this often entails taking down servers and such In traditional methods when the servers go down there is no longer any central authority to grant players items and what not It would be somewhat possible to sunset a game using blockchains where the state of the community is represented as the state of the blockchain If you want to trade an in game item with another player you can just add the transaction to the block chain Of course since its not backed by proof of work or something people can still write fraudulent stuff to the blockchain but at least there is some sort of online functionality still,0,1,0,1,0

I do really like the idea of using NFTSOpensea as a platform for having items i could use between many different games I make like having specific character portraits i dont necessairly need NFTs for it though its just that its a nice platform that would be easy to use instead of building my own and if the users can trade them aswell i guess that would make it more fun Dont really care that its on the blockchain though And i personally dont believe in NFTs in gamedev either as of now especially the part where you can share items between different games which makes absolutely no sense for me no developer is going to make items that another dev made be in their game for no incentive i do however like the usecase for your own games but for that youd need a strong brand If however someone makes a good usecase for NFTs im not going to dismiss it purely based on it using NFT based logic i just havent find anything interesting expect for ownership,0,1,0,1,0
Interoperable digital assets We get this through Steam inventory generally but even that isnt necessarily accessible between multiple games Personally I will only be using NFTs in a way that makes sense to some specific design choice not just as one of those weird play to earn games Imo most use cases that only involve a collectible aspect are in fact scams Most gaming companies that are using them really arent doing anything with them usually not even integrating them into gameplay in a meaningful way Personally Id love a digital TCG that used them but it seems like most of them dont like people trading cards so I guess that wont really be happening You could do a lot with 3rd party tools and tournaments with that kind of item database,0,1,0,1,0

I have an idea for preventing item duplications Each owner container has a wallet When the item is transferred to a container a transaction on the chain happens for that item If an item gets duped then itll have the same info as an item already on the chain and fail to spawn An item that is trashed cannot be respawned into the world because it was transferred into the wallet of infinite void With this system single player can trade on a market with work that proves that it wasnt just spawned in using hacks even if its just dirt I do know how to make a blockchain but not sure how secure itll be,0,0,0,1,0
Imo it makes more sense when you take away the image Its a currency that IPOs for folks to be enriched Its like when you have 2 pieces of paper I give one to you and I buy one for 100 Now you have smth worth 100 market value and I have net zero since my paper is also worth 100 market value Ie we made 100 out of thin air market value wise I guess this is where the scam comes in but its no different than housing or gold or silver or commodities trading So systematically because nfts and cryptos are money printing mechanisms since they create new assets with a semi liquid pool you see tons of people getting rich Another way of thinking about it is that it extends what you think of as money and makes it worth something because there is demand for it and thus a semi liquid pool for it to be traded this increases the overall amount of money increases M1 money supply in the system Note book value wise we both have 50 But market value wise like with housing or commodities or stocks if there is demand its 100 each Speaking of stocks NFTs are also really an IPO event for small studios or indie builders who cant afford to IPO on the stock market ICOs are for crypto projcts and NFT mints are for artists to IPO just like a normal company would All mechanics and criticisms are similar to IPOing in the stock market new wealth is created people buy smth for a promise of owning a businesss future prospects cash is generated for the project team to build and grow So not saying its not a place many scammers are at but nfts makes more sense as a currency to me Its also 10 other things incl an investment art money laundering mechanism membership card etc etc but a currency is one,1,1,0,1,0
Not really Heres the humble opinion of someone who has shipped a dozen AA games and 3 crypto apps The core value of a blockchain is it decentralizes ownership and transfer of whatever its set up to track This works well for things like currency where all you need to track is numbers and redeeming the number on the chain for something off the chain is also a noncentralized concernall you need to do is find someone willing to trade your number for something Bitcoin for pizza or eth for doge The major failing of NFTs is redeeming the thing on the chain and adding things to the chain is more convoluted then a number and is still a centralized concern Its just a convoluted way of tracking game assets Theres nothing stopping a game company from flooding the game with your asset devaluing it Theres also nothing stopping the game company from deciding youre not allowed to redeem the asset for whatever reason they can invent Its a buzzword,0,1,0,0,1

I kind of like the idea of NFTs but the whole current execution is so goddamn stupid What I image they would be good for is a way to show that you own some kind of digital media Right now if you want to sell a digital game on steam to a friend there is literally absolutely no option You cant trade digital books and movies like you used to be able to swap paperback books and physical disks But I think NFTs could be a solution here You have a public ledger you get tired of a game and you say look I want to sell this to person X and he now has proof of ownership so he can download it You do that you lose access to the game much like if you would lose access to the disk when you gave or loaned it away and now your friend can download and play it I think that would be neat Everything else out there right now is just scams and fuckery,1,1,1,0,0
The strongest cases I can think of are really quite weak A proprietary DB is superior over a distributed DB that no one owns in games owned by companies  But here are they are GameStop sells NFTs on their store and then pays video game makers to put support for the NFT in game Think like an MTX except it being sold by the company its sold outside the company and the company is paid a large fixed sum Why not keep it internal? This method allows a developer to connect into already popular MTXs that already exist and get paid in advance And its a way to market the game  They can put We support the funky dance mtx as a selling point for the game The second might actually be considered idea for NFTs is for low budget Indie game developers who cant afford to host a DB online for their game This is just using the existing NTF network a replacement for the db With the upside that if the indie developer ever goes out of business the db will remain in perpetuity,0,1,0,1,0
I can give you a few use cases The closest you can have to Physical ownership of a game You buy a game in a store its an nft you download it you play it you finished you sell it or do whatever you want Crossgames accountsitemsetc If a single company or multiple companies wants they can give you some meaning to the progress you made to another game just because the same NFT that represents an avatar or item or whatever is being interpreted into another game Decentralized Ingame economy You are playing an MMO you find an amazing item you want to sell it you do it without any intermediaries There are many more the important thing here is you have an ID is yours no one else have it Its up to the Game Developer to decide what that ID means in their world not up to the Blockchain developers,1,0,0,1,0
I mean the question phrased like this is a bit loaded so dont expect many nonbiased opinions here Theres a lot of misinformation wrong assumptions and fauxexperts in this thread I do agree that theres a lot of valid points against NFTs here as well not in the last place its current power usage though thats being worked on no doubt However let me present at least a plausible alternative that Ive heard is being worked on currently There are most definitely usecases where NFTs are an answer to a problem For example take a company like GOG They sell games DRM free currently Which is of course really nice But obviously this also leads to people sharing the executable without having bought it This is illegal but its trivially easy to do Now a little while back Steam had to change their entire policy Initially when you bought a digital game with them you owned it However now that the EU passed a law that says that digital ownership should come with the same consumer benefits as similar physical ownership buying a physical copy at the store which basically means you shouldve been allowed to resell your digital copy as second hand Steam went ahead and changed their entire service Now you dont own anything you buy on Steam even if it was bought before the law was passed You rent a perpetual license for a single fee Personally I think thats bullshit and just a way to get around the consumer protection laws of the EU Now obviously reselling digital games is not at all appealing to big AAA publishers After all whats in it for them? Back to GOG Lets say they sell you proof of ownership of any game you buy in the form of an NFT NFTs inherently allow you to send a certain preset percentage could also be 0 if you wish on reselling it back to its original owner the developer andor the publisher for example Especially with smaller single player indie games I could definitely see this being a valid option NFTs allow to be sold via the same protocol so theoretically any already existing market place for physical goods can be adjusted to also sell NFTs Im talking about eBay or even Amazon or maybe even Craigslist or Marktplaats over here Just like you would with a physical copy of the game In fact publishers would probably even prefer that because if you sell your physical copy second hand they wont see even a small percentage of those profits I as an indie developer would most certainly be interested in something like this And yes creating a API that allows you to do this via REST is also an option However then youd had to convince people that you have the manpower the computing power the always online guarantee and also to trust you with storing the keys until reselling Then people would have to implement this protocol for your service and then hope a bigger competitor with a different API doesnt come along The Web3 approach is solving a bunch of these issues by having a single unified way of connecting to and interacting with the store Thanks for coming to my TED talk This is just an example off the top of my head But I can think of several more that would benefit from such a service I personally dont think NFTs are going anywhere and hopefully theyll stop being associated with scammy and scummy JPEGsalesmen and more towards the technology Blaming NFTs for scams is like blaming HTTP for scams Its a protocol a tool People abuse it yes but itll mature over time EDIT I mean you can downvote me sure But OP asked for possible use cases and I gave them one If you dont like it thats fine But I think its kinda weak to downvote it just because you dont Im open to discussion Im open to feedback,1,1,0,1,0
DRM Digital Rights Management What would your system be doing? It would be Managing Digital Rights,0,0,0,1,0
I mean DRM might be a feature of it but not really Its made to be able to transfer ownership rather than just register it once on purchase and then have it be completely immutable But Steam is a DRM right? So is Origin UPlay and also GFWL and Denuvo the last two of which are some great examples of the worst player UX ever made None of these allow the features that I described right? So I dont really see why its just reinvented DRM because theres obviously added functionality thats enabled by NFTs By that logic HTTP is just reinvented TELNET,0,1,0,1,0
My issue with the conversation is the idea that current technology dictates future results The two most popular consensus models are designed firstly for currency exchange in proof of stake and proof of work Neither of those consensus mechanisms make sense for game development Even more than consensus is the assumption of assurance Customer assurance is the single largest hurdle for blockchain technology Once a solution comes in place that allows grandma to access the benefits of a blockchain without needing to write down 12 random words a hash or even own the gas currency we can start talking the benefits of NFTs In my opinion there are a plethora of situations in which blockchain and NFTs advance my games ecosystem outside of my direct monetization However no one cares about those use cases because of the massive obstacles the most popular networks face,0,1,0,1,1
I like to compare something like Magic the Gathering Online to a prospective NFT system Of course the system itself has to be constructed morally but lets look at what an NFT card game could offer if it committed to being opensource and minimallycentralized ie the creators really only control new card printing from the outset In MTGO your cards are on the Wizards of the Coast server for one Server gone cards gone You can only play on the WotC app despite any UIUX flaws it may have You can only play variants and tournaments that are explicitly offered by WotC You can only trade using their app and third party formoney trades require trust in a vendor that they will send you a card after being paid You can only play in supported languages and forget about anything like alternate art or color changes for accessibility as well as other accessibility changes dictation in any language etc Now consider an NFT care game using the technology to its full potential of empowering consumers The cards are on a public ledger that you prove ownership of with a private key only you know No entity can remove the log of these cards from existence they can be proven as yours unless a major major event like a 51 attack happens which requires the permission of many many more entities than the 1 entity WotC that controls the MTGO card database If the UIUX for the WotC app is bad or inaccessible people can simply write their own apps that you can take your NFT cards to and play there That means you can play any variant even house rules much like paper cards And even beyond the usability of paper cards you can have major accessibility changes that are impossible in the physical world Speakers of languages not supported by the WotC appfor example African or Indigenous American languagescould write and upload their own language patches for these apps to enable the game to be experienced by literally billions more players Players could also write modspatches enabling any possible accessibility option for disabled players Players could play cards with custom skins if they wanted complete custom experiencesthe possibilities of modification are endless And to cap it off trading is possible through any number of third party market places p2p or using trustless escrow services that are manned by essentially unbreakable algorithms instead of humans prone to greediness or scams When it comes to the environment they are certainly more environmentally friendly than say physical printing and international distribution of MtG cards And its not like energy issues arent being worked on as we speak the Ethereum blockchain is soon to move to ProofofStake which despite some valid criticisms does use magnitudes less energy than currently enough to pretty much obviate energy concerns As well they use electricity so simply using green energy also can help clear up environmental concerns The TLDR here is that used in a moral way NFTs are far more consumerfriendly than centralized digital goods They bring digital goods closer to the use cases of physical goods and actually allow for accessibility options beyond traditional physical goods Right now we are in a period much like the dotcom bubble where greedy people and companies are jumping on this hot new tech But dont get their greed confused with the tech itself NFTs can be an extremely powerful tool for end users to have more agency than they currently do at the hands of corporations In fact I wouldnt be surprised if big corporations have their part in astroturfing resistance to this conception of NFTs all the while pushing their inferior essentially centralized weakened version of NFTs But for NFTs and crypto in general to be used for good we need smart people on the side of good crypto and that means understanding the potential of the technology Its tech with a lot of power and right now there arent enough moral people in the space to prevent the badguys from using that power for greedy ends Crypto is already bringing equity to the third world though the hyperwealthy are already trying to shut that down by criminalizing DeFi Massive transfers of wealth from rich to poor countries are taking place in DeFi as we speak Sending remittances and getting microloans in developing nations is easier than ever because of crypto which is why places like India Nigeria and Brazil among many others have extremely high crypto adoption rates It also provides protection against actual fascist dictatorial governments attempting to assert control of citizens finances TLDRTLDR Crypto is a powerful technology that could be used for good or for evil Right now greedy corporations are abusing it while smart moral prudent nice people are being scared away because of this But we need those people more than ever to use crypto for what it should be used forconsumer agency global equity and financial freedoms Thanks for listening to my rant lol I hope it clears some things up! ,1,0,0,1,1
The current perception of NFT is completely warped by the current scam usage At its core NFT is basically data that is independent of an application You could imagine a character builder NFT where you define generic characters that you can then import in different games allowing you to reserve names and have a consistent character design across games You could imagine achievements being uploaded to the NFT so you could track the different games he beat But well its a lot of work to convince people to implement this standard in their games and their isnt tons of money to make with that sort of idea Easier to scam a few millions by selling JPEGs,0,1,1,0,0
I guess there is one I can think of A legacy item to be carried through several different games Something that grows with use and has a long history might be cool in some cases At least for MMORPGs However I dont really think it needs to be an NFT for this NFTs dont do anything that we cannot do without them I think I dont really know much about NFTs but if it is just an owners signature or something then I dont see the point Surely we can just have unique items that have only one copy in the game and it can be linked to a user as it has always been done with no additional technologies involved I get the appeal of having unique items that only you possess For example having a set of special powers in some game where there is a 11 relation with for every power and every user It would be a great experience to be known in a server as The one guy who can shoot fire or something but again no need for NFTs the only problem here is how to balance this stuff and what to do when the player stops playing,0,1,0,1,0
Ill give you the example of the one crypto game I know that isnt garbage Its a F2P card game where you can play 99 of the game for free There is one competitive game mode where you need to pay 15 USDC to play and if you do well you get a gold foil version of some specific cards they are minting that week and never again Those cards you can also exchange or sell to other players as NFTs unlike the common cards Theres also silver cards that are the same but without minting limits Thats about it Do you need crypto to do this? No you could do it without but it would be legallyfinancially more difficult Also youd need to code a bunch of trading systems and UI stuff Most other games that do this kind of thing have minimum withdrawal amounts awful exchange rates to ingame currency country restrictions dont let you put your own rules on how you want to move or trade your items etc TLDR A somewhat nicereasier way of doing legal RMT as part of the game design international Without giving fees to payment processors and maybe getting a cut of secondary sales PS No clue why people keep mentioning NFT inter operability Thats nonsense unless you as a developer were given an incredibly strong financial incentive to do such a thing,0,1,0,1,0

Plastic was seen as a revolutionary spaceage technology not dismissed as some cheap material Easier to form than wood way cheaper than metal Cheaper for industry to use than other materials Plastic fills an important role that could not really be filled by any other material which does not appear to be the case with NFTs hence why the OP is asking Its weird that you complain that people dont understand what NFTs are without actually explaining it yourself in a thread where the OP is asking to be informed about NFTs,0,1,0,0,0

May be a bit of a hot take here but I think they have potential in online games only thing is Im not too too understanding of how nfts work If you own what they are tied to I think it has potential of being able to tradesell skins on online games even if youre banned and want to recoup a bit of what you lost However if you dont own them then I would believe they as a whole are kinda stupid and useless I like the concept of nfts if you owned what you bought copyrights and everything But if you dont then I fail to see the purpose As uAxikita said their main point is that they are decentralized So while Id love to see them used and tied to things in games I play I wouldnt as a game dev want to implement them myself Id like to have some control on the player basefor things like hacking and stuff if you have no control its hard to make a perma ban stick,0,1,0,1,0
The primary use case for nfts is that they offer digital signatures for meta verse objects Obviously they are super edge case atm But depending on the up take of meta verse platforms in a WFH economy there could potentially be significant investment into nfts due to their inherent alignment to real world copyright laws Currently and sadly theyre simply just another layer of monetize everything and see where it lands,0,1,0,1,0
When I was learning about NFTs in a bootcamp I was in they were talking about its application in the used car market Basically youd get more info on how many people owned how good it is on gas mileage and even where the car has been etcthis is conceptually possible not a guarantee any of these things will happen Youd get more info from the blockchain than you would the guy trying to sell it to you While were on the topic I thought Id also throw in a use for blockchain as well since some folks might be interested Insurance They dont want to pay up ever and will drag things out as long as possible In a trustless system if x event happens and youre insurance covers it an AI will automatically pay out I still think theres some missing pieces here and Im not a super big fan of this stuffjust doesnt interest me nothing against it but on the whole I think there can be some good uses of the blockchain especially as far as cyber security is concerned,0,1,0,1,0

Kinda disappointed at these comments Putting value judgements on technology will come back to bite us in the ass From the most neutral perspective NFTs are fully programmable things and can be distributed without a centralized body Idk about you but this sounds like theres a TON of potential for what it can be used for Just because ppl are exploiting the most bottom of the barrel ideas now doesnt mean we should write of this technology Open source games copyleft applications community organizing and probably so many other cool ideas Lets use our imagination pls,1,0,1,1,0

NFTs are new Of course there are going to be struggles It wont be perfect out of the box Every no answer here is followed by a few statements that imply the commenter doesnt actually know how the tech works Obvious mistakes and false information The concepts of digital scarcity programmable currency and trustlessdecentralized applications are incredibly powerful These tools give individuals and small communities the opportunity to engage in commercesecure exchange and self governance without the need for central authorities dictating terms and middlemen leeching profits You dont need a central authority to enforce these things in the short term because its all enforced by the programs Anything that cant be enforced wont be implemented For example a jpg of a bored ape is 100 useless In the future decentralized ownership of centralized types of entities public services is completely possible and reasonable NFTs also have a long list of utilities in other avenues For example ecommerce Representing inventory as NFTs all but solves the unique item serialization problem Also only allowing customers with an NFT to buy products prevents bots NFTs for personal identification will help protect data in a huge way Including health data There are many more The blind hate needs to stop,1,1,0,1,0
So honestly an NFT is pointless if it has no utilization and it also depends on what its backing I get it art NFTs dont really have much utilization theyre essentially stamped money any added value is an economy of popularity So lets talk about NFTs and gaming You play a game and get a valuable sword now you can sell it and use it in other games supposedly The problem isnt the NFT backed by a gaming asset its always that you need an NFT to cash out and while they start cheap they value up quite quickly Town stars cheapest NFT is like 450 so now its very difficult to enter in Gods unchained bypassed this with welcome cards cards that are free NFTs but cant be sold so there its not a big deal so far idk who is following suit So we basically have open games with no cost but valuable NFTs but why not packaged games? Like snake why not make an NFT of the game and have an arcade protocol? It could bring games for purchase and games that require much less money but are limited in playability like a standalone arcade Better yet why not have an arcade contest like the ones in the 90s? If you own the game you could start a contest and have entry fees to have money to stake for reward distribution later on It would be great to use the low value F2E coins we cant really do much with wow 10 in BAT after 4 months thatsthats great Its a concept Im working on but Im just one person learning solidity from scratch Generally crypto arcades are greedy game creators the corporate ones are greedy and everyone is still trying to figure out the next big thing Im sure gala will have more to come but it does feel like a bunch of bullshit The readability of game data for smart contracts is very important but its still the same old model of buy our game thanks see ya never Generally yea scummy companies are able to jump on opportunities first But hold out hope another new ERC standard and everybody goes wild And were still very early I do think of like pizza hut using an nft backed by a coupon and in the metaverse you have a 3D modeled pizza unless you use it you could trade or sell it But digital coupons seem easy enough without using NFTs,0,1,1,1,1
There is Being able to sell digital copies of games you dont own physically Think of Steam Steam alone could already technically provide that on its own by allowing you to sell the games you buy on Steam to other users NFTs could extend that to allow you to sell those games to people who dont have a Steam account but for example an Origin account The Problem No provider of a gaming marketplace would want anyone to play games on their plattform without paying them first so thats never gonna happen,0,1,0,0,1

Ok so On The Positive Side I am a digital artist in a way My primary medium is glass but NFTs WOULD give me the ability to give my digital artwork both provenance and editions The problem is that even to a glassblower the amount of unnecessary waste involved in creating NFTs is enormous Even the idea of Clean NFTs doesnt hold much water with me The fact is that having dozens of competing crypto networks is ridiculously and fundamentally wasteful and if they shut down their worth at minting NFTs means zero Regardless being able to create something that goes with your physical artwork as a proof of originality would be a way to use NFTs Honestly of all the arguments I have heard for them this is the only one that holds much water with me,1,1,0,0,1

gtI dont know anyone whos made money on bitcoin Thats because most people never invested in crypto back in the day and still to this day even though its more popular your average person doesnt invest in it The people who made their money in Bitcoin and other coins are those who got it very early and held on to it Most people either dont invest or lose interest because theyre looking to make money quick so they dump it I only know one person who actually made significant profits Within the 50100k range profit and they bought a mix of Bitcoin Ethereum etc back in 2017 and held on to it until the crypto market exploded and they sold amp#x200B gtIve never been in a store where paying with bitcoin was an option Bitcoin would not be good as a payment option because its not a stable coin Not just Bitcoin but pretty much any crypto coin that is not stable in price will never be used as a daily payment driver Think of these coins to be more comparable to stocks you dont get them to use them daily but rather to make money out of them on the stock exchange For daily payments there are stable coins out there like USD Coin Tether etc These are meant to be on the same value as the real dollar and dont fluctuate a lot in price As for not seeing crypto being used in stores I havent either But I have heard of some places and even seen a few Bitcoin ATMs Its rare for now amp#x200B gtWhat problem does it fix that I cant solve with my credit card? Whats an everyday cryptocurrency use case that isnt more easily and reliably solved by regular money? The main idea behind using crypto is to have a public ledger that keeps track of the data and is verified over the blockchain network Say I send you some crypto from my wallet to yours that transaction is visible to pretty much everyone I guess this could also be a bad thing thing because now many people see where all the coins are going Where as with a bank its private information From the public anyways The only other thing I can think of is possibly an advantage of is sending money over the blockchain may be more convenient than other ways such as wire transfer etc But there could also be a downside to this if more people start using this for instance if you use the Ethereum blockchain and the network is busy the fees for the transaction can be quite high and not worth the hassle There are other cheaper blockchain options out there but again this is all too early to tell We do know that crypto is here to stay and the government are probably gonna get more involved,0,1,1,1,0

Agreed on both counts Its a decent idea for digital ownership and there isnt a huge incentive right now to do it Maybe maybe a company will take the risk of doing it in terms of seeing if they can boost sales Yeah the game is 60 at release but you can sell it whenever you want so maybe in a few months you can sell it for 40 if youre done with it On paper it makes sense to me but I can see a lot of big companies just saying fuck that Which to me seems to be an issue with a lot of block chain and nft investment generally The tech can trend towards a kind of user independence sure But major tech investment is all about finding and establishing a platformwalled garden to establish dedicated and repeat customers Letting users take game skins for example and use them between different games or sell independently on an autonomous market sounds cool maybe But companies dont want to work with their competitors like that they dont want to be shut out of the 2nd hand market if they want to allow it at all So companies could make blockchains and NFTs that are proprietary dont work with other markets lock users into their walled gardens etc But then whats the point of using NFTs or block chain at that point? Might as well just set it all up on a private server,0,1,0,1,1

its funny how obsessed people are with the idea of reselling a copy of something that is practically infinitely replicable like at least a new sale gives back to the creator giving them reason to create more things so theres and value addition with creator sale but a used sale of digital item doesnt really make sense like if it was a physical good we save on the materials for manufacturing another copy so theres value addition of the convenience of not having to do that and of course availability and scarcity are in question but with a digital good it just doesnt really make sense it basically sounds like a scam there is no value add to this process i mean maybe if its a digital game that is no longer available and you need to verify the copys authenticity but NFTs dont really do that like you cant really ask for the token from someone and then ask the NFT system to verify its authenticity because theres no system to do that you can mint and you can transfer so basically you can do everything that allows you to give money to the creators of the NFT system but you cant actually use it for anything actually useful or its purpose of verification you can verify the token itself is an authentic NFT but you cant verify the authenticity of the screenshot or game copy which cant fit in the NFT so you have to trust the person on the other end to actually send you a copy if you buy the token from them,0,1,1,0,0

Only in so much that independent markets can form outside of the influence of the developerspublishers Not saying thats either good or bad just what it enables Trading ingame items for fiat for example has historically been banned or discouraged whereas if a developer wanted to encourage and support that behaviour NFTs would be a standardised mechanism for doing so,0,0,0,1,0
I would Naively thinkanytime the system has a currently corrupt or questionable authority? Not to say that nfts cant be exploited I think everything can be exploited Say a company has leveraged their power to abuse a contracted labor as they often do could a decentralized system theoretically be applied to make that harder to do? Eg large company contracts a tiny self owned business to do a job and because they realize that relationship is highly one sided and even legal recourse is problematic and highly unlikely they can just not pay Would having a decentralized system of payment and agreement be applicable there?,0,1,0,1,1
And theres nothing stopping developers from doing that without NTFs or crypto being involved at all and it has already been done in games a big famous example of this is the D3 auction house The reason why its usually banneddiscouraged is because both players and developers dont want that to happen For majority of players its a p2w mechanic that shouldnt exist when its not exclusive to cosmetics and for developers its a loss of money as people would simply buy the items from others that no longer want them instead of buying them from the developer leading to no or small amount of cash going to the developer the profit is just usually not enough to warrant supporting such a system compared to outright selling those items in some form,0,1,0,0,1
First off the main point is that NFTs are a small thing not worthy of the attention they receive That said you can have both a centralized authority and a decentralized market For example a game might want to use NFTs to sell unique items These items would be validated by a central authority but they would be able to be traded amongst the players without using a 3rd party For example I could send you a unique ingame sword without using the game at all And then when you login to the game the centralized authority would now recognize you as the owner of the sword without having any record of the transaction in the game,0,1,0,1,0
This is what further bothers me about NFTs in games They arent centralized to the developerpublisher The only incentive they have for making them is to sell them off immediately but then they are now in the hands of the secondary market so why should they care about them after that and thus support them? For example with Ubisoft wanting to do NFT skins for games part of the deal is that those skins would be available across multiple generations of games But what if they just Werent? Whos stopping them? What incentive do they have to develop that NFT skin across multiple games when after theyve initially sold it they cant make a single cent from it from then on anymore and then they are expected to put in development timemoney in keeping it in future games? NFT supporters often bring crossgame compatibility as a reason to want them but why would other developers want to spend their own resources making the NFT you bought from another game work in their game as well? Especially when they will never see a dime of your NFT purchase? Also what about NFT power creep? Real life products such as Magic The Gathering often suffer from this problem where something that you bought from them and now own can be completely invalidated by another product that is just a better version of yours potentially rendering yours worthless They have all of the incentive to do this in order to keep sales up while you already bought yours so they dont need to care about you anymore Sure this has to be taken into consideration when trying to make an overall healthy product but thats for something like a trading card game that relies on its whole to work whereas a yearly video game release only needs to care until the next iteration comes out Who could possibly want something like this in a video game?,0,1,1,0,1
NFTs and Blockchains main USP is decentralization If you cant actually decentralize that loses all value and NFTs lose their USP NFTs exist to decentralize ownership you can own something without a central system saying you do But if you then need a central system to verify the valuecontent of the thing you own decentralized do you really have it decentralized?,0,1,0,0,1

Why do you need NFTs for that? I guess the crypto bros like them as theyre tied to crypto but then again most people prefer real money,0,1,1,0,0
My point is that being decentralized means they dont need some authority to step in and verify someone has ownership of something to use it somewhere Yet you need to have companies step in to verify people have ownership of NFTs How does Twitter know you own a bored chinchilla or whatever? It has to make the decision that you are indeed the owner By doing so it becomes a centralized authority If someone else actually owns said bored chinchilla but Twitter went ahead and marked you as the owner now theres a huge issue of Twitter making an inaccurate call but because they are the ones in charge of verifying your bored chinchilla for your profile picture they get the final say So you could technically own a bored chinchilla but Twitter has decided someone else actually owns it and allows them to use it as their profile photo What are you going to do about it? Absolutely nothing A truly decentralized system would involve Twitter not being the arbiter Your bored chinchilla would just be your avatar and Twitter wouldnt be the middle man But this isnt how it works and it wont work like this in the future either You can show receipts all day long but they are worthless unless a centralized authority actually acknowledges it Having an NFT of a videogame item only has value if the videogame acknowledges you are the actual owner Just like owning a digital skin in a videogame only matters if the videogame allows you to actually use it Theres really no difference to the videogame amp#x200B If you bought expensive zebra print gun wrap from someone as an NFT and then wanted to use it in COD or something but COD was like you dont own this or we took the zebra skin out of the game then you essentially own nothing of value,0,1,0,0,1
gtB Being able to prove ownership of an imaginary thing that some people may in certain circumstances argue relates to a real thing What I dont understand is why so many people are convinced that scammers amp NFTs are the same thing Its like if you saw the scalpers outside a ball game and then assumed tickets as a concept are a scam,0,1,0,0,1
This has nothing to do with me claiming someone is using NFTs or blockchain for a scam this has everything to do with the actual literal limitations of the technology It is a limitation of NFTs as a technolgy that at some point they must interface with the rest of the world ie a privately owned service At that point it is going to be outside of the hands of the design of a blockchain or smart contract whether the people involved with the thing the token refers to decide to honour the claim to ownership NFTs tangibly are just a string of data with no intrinsic meaning Unless you are imagining a world where we have moved the entirity of perceivable reality to the blockchain which I guess is what is being proposed inadvertantly by the majority of maximallists,0,1,0,0,1
I think youre interpreting trustlessness as codeislaw instead of as open accountability and verifiability for NFTs Of course there will always be an element of human trust in any kind of social contract like tickets money vouchers game skins achievements participation proofs NFTs isnt going to make a codeislaw system where you can 100 rely on the NFT to be true for the reasons you list here The difference here is you cant modify a transaction or a signature that happened in the past You can create a new contract and disregard the old one but everything will remain public and unchanged While this is framed as something bad it really just creates a high degree of accountability since anyone can jump into an explorer and inspect the ledger Was a new house registered unjustly? You can check the history of registrations now! Also one side effect of using a shared system for these things is that it just makes this data a lot more interoperable compared to if every service registered these things themselves,1,0,0,1,0
When I say Trustless Im referring to how every crypto system uses some technique to replace trust in a centralized authority with some other hardtofake proof of legitimacy eg proof of work or proof of stake These generally consume significant resources like processing power or storage space in order to replace the centralized authority saying yep this is the legitimate record Those resources seem to cost a lot of money I regularly hear of NFT minting costs on the order of 50100 If Im understanding your point correctly it sounds like youre saying that nfts are basically valuable because theyre Really Good receipts and sure I can see that they do that job But how much value is the crypto part of it actually adding to the people making the choice on what technology to use? How much money is a game dev company willing to spend on a security measure that compared to a public transaction ledger that it maintains itself only really protects against changes from within the game dev company itself? Im sure that 50 price tag isnt a hard law Im sure that it could be made cheaper as a tradeoff against security Im sure that this will be experimented with by different systems until someone finds the appropriate market value But I find myself really wondering if the crypto part will be valued at all once the hype dies down even if you want a reliable public ledger it just seems a lot cheaper to have some trusted company or agency maintain a noncrypto blockchain like say wikipedia or github versus using crypto techniques to secure it,0,1,0,1,0
That clip neatly demonstrates the internets core purpose it offers a means to instantly fetch large amounts of information at long distances which is something that was previously impossible and something that has many immediately apparent use cases even in the 90s 80s and earlier This was by design from its inception The host flippantly jokes about how for listening to a baseball game a radio and tape recorder can do the same job and Bill plays along because its a lighthearted interview but we can easily see why the host is wrong 1 The hosts proposed solution doesnt work A tape recorder wont help you instantly listen to a game you missed 2 The example itself is valid but a bit silly The internet was designed for military and academic uses and by the 90s had demonstrated its capabilities for sharing knowledge in multiple fields It had shown its use as a nearinfinite library a means for free education and a means of building communities in previously impossible ways Reducing the technologys purpose to baseball results trivialises what the it had already accomplished So when we say that NFTs are a solution looking for a problem much like the hosts critique of the internet the appropriate response would be to demonstrate the technologys apparently obvious use cases and to point to the technologys blossoming accomplishments But this doesnt work because 1 Experienced developers are really struggling to find a use case for NFTs that hasnt already been neatly solved by other technologies Why wouldnt I use a database? sounds like a flippant dismissal akin to why wouldnt I use a tape recorder? except well databases actually solve the problems presented 2 NFTs are fundamentally designed to distribute a scarce resource and as such outside of some incredibly niche examples they have only really thrived as a means to sell jpegs for large sums of money Its difficult to believe any promises about what the technology could do when its history and design show it as nothing but a getrichquick tool This is fundamentally different to the internets history,0,1,0,0,1

gt but we can easily see why the host is wrong Today we can see that sure with the benefit of hindsight but if you were involved in tech in the 90s youd know that the vast majority of people not directly involved in building the internet saw it as nothing more than a solution looking for a problem I remember sitting in a meeting where we first discussed transferring data over the Internet and all the old timers absolutely scoffed at the idea Pulling out their brown paper to show how much easier and cheaper it is to just load the tapes onto a truck and drive them across the country There were exactly two people in that meeting who thought it was worth it to start setting up the infrastructure to transfer over the Internet In the end we were too junior to be taken seriously and eventually the company hired expensive consultants to build the internet transfer years later gt1 Experienced developers are really struggling to find a use case for NFTs that hasnt already been neatly solved by other technologies Why wouldnt I use a database? sounds like a flippant dismissal akin to why wouldnt I use a tape recorder? except well databases actually solve the problems presented I personally work with brilliant developers who are implementing fascinating use cases In that example tape recorders also solve the problem of being able to listen to a baseball game whenever you want The use cases where youd use a blockchain for are very different from an rdbs The experience features and disadvantages are as different as a tape recorder vs YouTube gt2 NFTs are fundamentally designed to distribute a scarce resource and as such outside of some incredibly niche examples they have only really thrived as a means to sell jpegs for large sums of money Its difficult to believe any promises about what the technology could do when its history and design show it as nothing but a getrichquick tool This is fundamentally different to the internets history You obviously just dont really know much about them if thats all you can see I assume you first heard about nfts last year In fact theres infinite other uses just like theres infinite uses for a generic database,0,1,1,1,0

Yeah I guess Im arguing against the Crypto part not necessarily the blockchain part A blockchain on its own is just a data structure and it has some cool features especially in contexts where you care about being able to view the revision history I feel like NFT tends to refer to a cryptocurrencybacked blockchain update and I dont think that actually provides technical value in almost any use case But like if you throw out the crypto part sure Make a public blockchain ledger for tax spending transparency Have community verification Represent your game state as a series of incremental update steps so that you can rewind time Theres cool stuff to be done with that,0,1,0,1,0

No NFTbased ownership would not reintroduce played it trade it markets because you dont owntrade the actual game you own an NFT that says you own the game The NFT doesnt actually ensure you own the game the connection between the ownership and the game must be verified by the people hosting the actual games data at which point nothing changes and youve reinvented the wheel Since transaction history is freely and openly available the people hosting the game can just check if the NFT has been traded before granting access to the game,0,1,0,0,1

If we do how do we keep that straight across all of the people and companies involved with the process of buying a home? What if grandma doesnt understand how it all works? That scenario creates a demand for Blockchain experts people who know the ins and outs of the entire system and that what creates a niche for scammers All it takes is one guy to go yeah sure just give me your login info and Ill take care of it to clean out Grandmas entire digital wallet Then that just creates another area where endless forking can happen And I mean otherwise whats going to stop people from doing that?

The advantage is that you keep a record of the inital contract and the messy back and forth Of course things has to be settled in court The thing blockchain brings to the table is that the data is publically available and you cant tamper with the timestamp signature or records Append only doesnt mean you cant make changes Git is technically also append only but without the consensus mechanisms Append only permissionless public ledger The alternative is a ledger where someone can modify history you cant verify or even read the contents of it and theres a custodian with permissions to readwrite in the ledger Just because anybody can write in it doesnt mean that its correct I can write a note where I promise to sell you tulips and the Eiffel tower on a piece of paper or in a public ledger but that would be stupid of me because now its forever publically available data If the government had a private key and used a public ledger I could verify that the note is signed by them and I would have access to a lot of data I wouldnt have otherwise,0,1,0,1,0
If we are talking about companies shutting down and not honoring NFTs is it a huge benefit to just lose an entire database?,0,0,1,0,1
Literally everything you just described is also entirely possible within existing systems without touching Blockchain From what I can tell Blockchain does more to LEGITIMIZE fraudulent activity than prevent it In everything youve said here you havent addressed whats preventing someone from just tricking a mark into signing over their account and with it everything they own in it If someone can gain access to your wallet they can transfer everything you own in it to themselves As far as the Blockchain is concerned this is a legitimate transaction The only recourse is to appeal to the people capable of doing so to reverse the transaction whether by forking appending whatever what practical material advantage does this provide over existing systems besides that the fact that its a different system? If things still have to go to court if you can still appeal to authorities to have the record changed what is actually any different from things as they exist now? Isnt the whole point of the move to crypto and Blockchain that its decentralized and authorityfree? Even from what youre saying the benefits of added transparency dont amount to anything more than what you can already do with a FOIA request None of this sounds any different than what I already think of all of this its a fancy receipt thats an absolute bear to make changes to,0,1,0,0,1
Youre missing the point In this case imagine the only reason NFTs would exist would be to represent ownership NFTs only hold value so long as the platform honours them If the platform doesnt honour then then they have no value and there is no reason for them to exist Obviously my comment assumes there is a platform that honours them otherwise there is no point in the first place,0,1,0,0,1
Also the grandmas can get a government custodial wallet or a shared multisignature wallet to get her government protection if they needed to use this system directly themselves for some reason,0,0,0,1,1
if you have a platform that you trust to honor NFTs why wouldnt they just let you trade their games without needing to go through a blockchain? what does an NFT add to this scenario? if you think the game company would renege on your game ownership and stop you from transferring games theyd do the exact same thing if you owned an NFT lol,0,1,0,0,1
How would that work in practice? This assumes that the government is actively involved in this system now Have they just accepted that they have no actual control over an in this example extremely significant sector of the economy? Do they just accept that they have no regulatory control over the housing market in this example? If someone scams someone else out of the legal ownership of their home how is that rectified? If the Blockchain says that the house legally belongs to the scanner and all they have to go on otherwise is Grandmas word doesnt that imply HUGE vulnerabilities and points of failure no matter who the final say ends up on the side of? Who decides this anyway? The courts? Does the Blockchain have an administrator who has to sign off on all of these things? If so didnt we just circle back around to creating government anyway?,0,1,0,0,1
Well the main benefit to using blockchain is decentralisation In this context that means the platform commits to not interfere with any secondary markets This just occurred to me but it also opens your game collection as financial leverage as it would have a discernable transferable value without physical depreciation,1,0,0,1,0
Im hoping that people would actually try to do something like this you mentions here Like most of the programs like photoshop or these were expensive because they worried of piracy Than they came out with this you dont own the product but pay monthlyyearly fees for it Which is pretty bad and NFTs maybe can get back to the old days even you can get cheaper but good softwares because the identifications of the programs are based on this crypto algorythm Dont know how its achievable but Im pretty sure no matter what people always start to abuse systems when they get familiar with,1,0,0,1,0
you didnt answer the question at all the only reason an NFT has value is if someone is willing and able to enforce it but if a company is willing to enforce ownership of an NFT and people trust them to do it what purpose does the blockchain serve?,0,1,0,0,1
what benefits do any of these have on being able to trade games? if steam decided to allow you to trade games between accounts without a blockchain what benefits would the blockchain add to that system?,0,1,0,1,0
So you understand that NFTs value only comes from the platforms deciding to honor them So you trust the platform to honor your NFTs So why dont you trust them to honor an account within their database? It still doesnt bring back the played it trade it because companies can just decide not to honor NFTs that have been traded,0,1,0,0,1
This feels a bit circular If a company commits to creating NFTs as proof of ownership including the inherent property of NFTs that they can be traded lets assume theyre committing to honouring them otherwise you can use the same argument for any service why buy a game on Steam when they can just close their doors tomorrow or arbitrarily revoke my access?,0,1,0,0,1
It seems like you understand my point NFTs dont add anything and have a whole host of downsides,0,1,1,0,0
in that sense its not effecting anything directly more like indirectly However I may misunderstand the whole concept of crypto but afaik the so called miners just validating transactions therefore its hard to steal copy etc If I say I would like to sell my product but I fear that some people will crack it no matter what doesnt the nft or this authenticating process helps that? So of there is no piracy I van safely sell my product on a lowered price? as I said I may be fully misunderstanding this topic,0,1,0,1,0
I hear you no worries Theres a lot of misconceptions going around At the end of the day an NFT is a fancy receipt It has nothing to do with the program itself it didnt change anything within existing code In order for it to provide authentication like that that functionality has to be put into the program itself most likely you link your crypto wallet to the programaccount and then it checks to make sure you have the token every day or so This application is basically DRM if youre familiar Its just checking in a database to say whether or not you have permission to use it If you ARE familiar with DRM you already know where this goes If you arent the long and short of it is that theres literally no DRM that hasnt been successfully cracked NFTs are absolutely no more fortified against cracking like this except in this case one way they could do it is by just getting into your wallet account at which point they could take literally everything you have in there So no more secure but far more potential for catastrophic failure on an individual level Heres a great and thorough primer on the subject if you have time Makes a good listen while youre doing chores I can say from experience ,0,1,0,0,1
It adds value by doing the exact same thing as what has already been done? where is the value? What is added? You still rely on trusting the developers to honor your NFTs If developers wanted you to be able to trade your game they could make it so you could likewise if developers dont want you to trade your game NFTs dont change that Energy costs Art theft General purposelessness especially in this case Tokenizing things that dont need to be tokenized You agree NFTs are worthless if the developers dont honor them So clearly the value is not created by the NFTs its created by the developers If you trust them to honor an NFT why cant you trust them to honor their own database?,0,1,0,0,1
If the digital platforms you use dont support the NFTs i dont see how having one will help,0,1,1,0,0
But couldnt the game just disallow any transfer of ownership anyway? They could check the blockchain to see if youre the original owner and disallow usage of the ingame item if youre not Thats why this is all so silly its ALWAYS up to the publisher whether theres a public ledger or not,0,1,0,0,1
The point is they can but they dont have to There are options And with options comes choice Maybe it makes sense to have an NFT but limit trading sure That can be programmed And maybe you dont need an NFT for your game after all Its all about greater options and possibilities not just saying solution looking for a problem and downvoting because bad,1,0,0,1,0
It will only work if the whole game files are stored on blockchain Thats what NFT promises and no one want that It prevents game developers from updating a game patch would have to be a separate token It requires gigantic token size Blockchain operations would cost few hundreds more than a purchased game and that would increase the price drastically Its exactly what happened with first NFT images They were promising that you own an image while in reality you only had ownership of a txt file that contains some metadata and the image is stored on some server And they did it because it was easier to store 4KB of data on blockchain than 4MB Now imagine if you had to store 60GB of a game Thats why you only store an ID And thats part of big NFT lie You dont own the product you own the receipt,0,1,0,0,1
So if we assume thats possible which other people have refuted elsewhere why the fuck would developers want to do that? A developer has absolutely zero incentive to allow people to resell their digital game because it makes them nothing So given the choice between having games on a digital marketplace like Steam or selling it as an NFT which one do you think devs would pick?,0,1,1,0,0
Im all for digital ownership Ive bought albums on bandcamp to support musicians I like and I work as an illustrator so digital ownership of the files I make is one of the main things I sell In my view the relevant technology for digital ownership is a contract and maybe a download of the file not an NFT You can certainly write a contract thats dependent on an NFT if you want but an NFT without a contract is just a publicly verifiable hyperlink You can make contracts exclusive you can write them to set terms on the resale of the asset you can do all the ownership stuff that NFTs promise without the NFT I dont at all intend to dismiss some of the things NFTs are being used in conjunction with like digital ownership and limited releases I just dont think NFTs contribute significantly to those in a way that will be judged as useful or essential once the hype dies down,0,1,0,1,0
If youre asking for my personal opinion then I dont think platforms should use NFTs for ownership today I dont think the intersection is understood well enough to make it a compelling safe user experience Clearly there are machinations in this space though Maybe they have figured out some of the stuff we dont know,0,1,0,1,1
Very true but neither do you own the picture that you purchased the NFT of in any real way The artist can still do with it whatever they want reprint distribute and you cant do any of those things copyright violation and the video game for which you own the NFT for a particular character may shut down or revoke the character in a balance patch if they so desire,0,1,0,0,1
Youre right of course But for the purposes of a good faith discussion lets assume that it isnt a scam and the platform agrees to honour NFT ownership You buy an NFT can do what you want with it otherwise why else is it an NFT and always have access to the game it represents,1,0,0,1,0
Is there an edge case for proving ownership in a situation where you dont trust the trusted end? Say I think the government is trying to pull a fast one or some such thing Or do nfts have an inherent quality that makes them unusable for that?,0,1,0,1,0
Essentially no The trustless part of the NFT only reaches as far as the blockchain it lives on If youre interacting with any kind of authority that deals in NFTs they remain in control of how much they respect their own NFTs I might own a legendary sword as an NFT which guarantees that I can trade it away on third party exchanges and the people buying it are guaranteed that they will be able to use the sword in the game right? Except thats not true at all A game developer might decide that my NFT has been stolen or is too old to keep supporting and simply just stop recognizing its existence in their game client Or they could change it to be irrelevant in a balance patch Or they could mint another 100 copies of the sword I technically still own it on the chain but the chain ends up not being the truth that anyone cares about The game client is If I trust a game company not to do any of that why did we need the NFTs? Same thing with a government wanting to screw you over If their truth doesnt agree with that the blockchain says they will disregard it,0,1,0,0,1
But if the platform honors the ownership then its really no different than them just using a database The only difference of using a blockchainbased solution to using an SQL database or whatever weve been doing for many decades is that a third party can still independently verify your ownership of the token even if the platform stops to honor your claim This makes it worthwhile for stores of value like currency but in the case of a game the platform is the only counterparty that matters anyway,0,1,0,1,0
Yes it all comes down to trust well two points of trust in this case But by making that database public youre removing one factor of trust from the hands of the platform and putting it into a public blockchain Suddenly no one can dispute that I own the NFT because we can cryptographically prove it,1,0,0,1,0
You dont own an NFT either Heck you only own a Bitcoin as long as a majority agrees that you own it If a chain forks buh bye!

I dont quite get your simile but if youre a capitalist then perhaps you do not think developers should use NFTs as like you say the immediate result will be lower profits Why give up a 5 cut every time a player makes a trade?

gt which in practice amounts just to some sort of prestige for the company Which is a misunderstanding of how stocks work There are lots of reasons why you might want to own a stock You COULD plan on selling that stock later hoping for capital gains but thats not the only thing stock is good for Many companies offer to pay dividends to stockholders for the stocks they hold Its kind of like when your credit card charges you an interest rate for loaning you money the company is sort of paying back a thank you for loaning me your money as an investment heres a small return And you can build a stock portfolio that is entirely based around receiving dividends as a passive income that arent expected to make large capital gains In fact most of the already successful companies are like that Amazon Google Coca Cola a lot of these companies arent expected to see any more growth in the markets they already dominate but people still want to own the stock because they pay their shareholders a nice amount And they pay the shareholders a nice amount because it keeps their stock desirable which makes the price higher which means the company has more money to spend on their business As well lots of companies hold stockholder or shareholder meetings where company direction and electing CEOs is determined by these stock holders So if youre actually interested in any sort of governing of a particular corporation thats another reason you might want to own that stock Yeah there are tons of people treating the stock market LIKE a casino but that is not its purpose and its not how it functions if you dont TREAT IT like a Casino,0,1,0,1,0
TLDR Gaming NFTs will open the door for adoption in other commercial sectors Everything you own will soon have a digital identity amp#x200B In 2020 54 billion US dollars was spent on supplementary ingame purchases Approximately zero of it trickled down to resale value for purchasers Seem unfair? Thats because it is Its also why Justin Kan considers gaming NFTs a bigger opportunity than streaming hed probably know he built Twitch Gaming does seem like a perfect use case for NFTs We grind for hours to collect resources and craft items Many of our Fifa avatars have more swag than our actual fits So why shouldnt we be able to trade and sell these digital goods? We bought them We earned them Now think how NFTs will disrupt this system digital items that were once centralized and produced at zero cost can now be part of real world secondary economies Interoperability solutions like BTP from ICON and CCIP from LINK will allow NFT skins to be worn in both Fortnite and COD and then listed for resale Teams like mine are developing open world MMOs where the characters resources and crafted items are tradable NFTs right now Eventually video games themselves will be resold on secondary markets If you are a GamestopWeb3 follower you know this In fact its probably why you are in this space But now lets talk about where things get really exciting the dissolving line between physical and virtual economies NFTs will allow physical goods like Nike soccer cleats to be instantly linked to their digital versions providing both proof of ownership and virtual utility For example you go to the store buy some Vapors Instantly your Fifa Avatar has the same kit Then if you want to sell the cleats in real life you trustlessly prove the sale via NFT transfer Bada bing bada boom Ownership democratized digital goods given value an entire new economy created Following this model NFT assets and their secondary marketplaces are poised to revolutionize not just gaming but commerce in general Soon we will start to see NFT items for all major retailers most likely starting with art and fashion verification Supreme and Gucci which have a huge problem with counterfeits will use NFTs for authenticity verification and allow you to rep their brands in the metaverse Dont be surprised when IKEA Bed Bath and Beyond and other mainstream adoption quickly follows Everything you own will have a digital identity And with that comes proof of ownership resale opportunity and massive amounts of disruption and innovation Some feel the recent metaverse push is premature Thats fair The tech isnt there yet and the public hasnt been prepped But big tech recognizes NFTs are a game changer and they are rushing now to build the infrastructure of the future I want this infrastructure to be built according to blockchain first principles and not the selfinterest of tech overlords like Zuckerberg And so I build Starting with my teams first gaming project that I hope to see on Immutable XGamestops NFT marketplace soon In the meantime I also buy DRS and hold Because I believe in Ryan Cohen the blockchain community and that NFT gaming will be Gamestops Trojan Horse for the web3 revolution,1,0,0,1,0

Ill probably get downvoted as a shill but I do have a genuine question Lets say I buy an outfit for 20 If I list it for resale I can list it for 10 Theres no depreciation of value like a physical item So wouldnt that detract from the earnings from the creator of The NFT? Doesnt it seem to decrease the MSRP of the item? Or is there a floor of how much each item can be resold?,0,1,0,0,1
Its a very good question Royalties are built into NFTs so creators profit off every secondary sale Im sure there are researchers writing theses right now about the economic implications of this model Theoretically if you cap the supply and demand is high the increasing prices of these secondary sales will drive more value than unlimited supply without resales,1,0,0,1,0
Am also curious how can we prevent the creator from increasing the supply secretly to sell more of their supposedly limitededition NFT? Whats stopping them from doing so? How can this minting activity be identified and curbed if we dont always have eyes watching all the wallets?,0,0,0,1,1
I dont have the answers to most of that but I can bring up smart contracts that support optional royalties where the creators can continue receiving a percentage of all subsequent sales I think that feature is a real game changer in a lot of ways,1,0,0,1,0
Yes if there is excess supply it will drive price down Conversely though if there is excess demand it will drive the price up and the creator will get larger royalties This model allows for a fixed supply which is key for this to work if the creator is endlessly minting new copies then of course it will become worthless,1,1,0,0,0
Gaming is actually the Trojan horse to DeFi People who stake in games like Axie Infinity are seeing much higher interest yield than traditional bank products CDs annuities etc Customer acquisition cost and customer success campaigns for Fintech products is very high Through gaming getting customers in is cheaper and getting customers to learn how things work is also much easier Or they dont even need to completely understand how it works hey just see better returns compared to traditional investment products and low barriers to enter,1,0,0,1,0

confidential NFTs are a prime use case for confidential computing Oasis achieves this by using trusted execution environments where data processing happens with endtoend encryption So the input data is encrypted and along with the smart contract that incorporates the customizable confidentiality settings to the NFTs they enter a blackboxlike secure enclave Inside this isolated environment the data is decrypted and computations take place confidentially and in the strictest tamperproof manner Finally the output data is encrypted once again This is the essence of smart privacy that the data always go through confidential computation hence the NFTs that are created from tokenized information enjoy data sovereignty and security with only the owner having complete access control and the discretion to share fully partially or not at all,1,0,0,1,0

The DAO growth have been an interesting trend which I believe that will continue as token governance is highly important for a truly decentralised economy! When I have some serious investment I always make sure I take active part on its governance and I prefer individual voting allocations like it happens on DIA DAO in position to delegation of tokens amp voting power to a pool While fine for a more handsoff aproach the downside is huge as massive amounts of tokens end up in the hands of Coinbase Binance or even Lido which gain a MASSIVE voting power out of its investors,1,0,0,1,0

The research paper Once again I used chatGPT to offer me a more simple explanation though if youre up for reading the somewhat dense text go for it The final section in the paper is summarized thanks to chatGPT and I checked it out just to be safe whether or not it was correct DAOs are organizations run by computer programs that operate on a blockchain They are meant to be decentralized meaning no one person or entity controls them However our research has found that many DAOs are not as decentralized as they claim to be with a small group of people holding most of the power To make DAOs more decentralized we suggest using incentive mechanisms to encourage more people to participate and separating voting power from monetary value We also suggest using artificial intelligence to factcheck and prevent echo chambers and moving more of the DAOs decisionmaking process onto the blockchain for greater autonomy and transparency,0,0,0,1,1

The 253 you reference from the banks is a bit misleading actually Banks make ahem bank off of these products Way more than 253 First of all banks arent lending their money theyre lending other peoples money So right there theyre earning in the 1000s of percentage return because theyre not even using their money and theyre returning about 5 to the depositors and we havent even gotten into fractional banking at this point but lets keep it simple Then they stack almost ALL of the interest payments at the front of the amortization schedule so theyre getting interest upfront and giving up principle at the back end Then almost every loan is refinanced within the first 10 years of the loan so they then collect fees and reset the interest to principle ratio once again Interesting fact banks are much more profitable in these lowrate environments because theyre not making money on the rate but on the spread Its hilarious how people are always trying to get the lowest rates banks couldnt care less about the rate but theyre very happy that its the only thing people think about when getting a loan Im just illustrating that comparing the standard 30 yr mortgage to the lending in defi isnt comparing apples to apples But it does illustrate how truly profitable finance is Theres a reason why banks own the biggest buildings in the most expensive areas and have the best lobbyists and the richest executives etc Its this massive bloated middle man that controls the flow of money and stacks all of the stakes in their favor By removing that there is a LOT of money to be redistributed Defi will be completely revolutionary and will eventually make the current banking model obsolete And I dont even understand Defi perfectly,0,1,1,1,0
You bring up a good point Crypto wont have lower borrowing rates until the credit system has been integrated Then we might see blockchain mortgages and the like As far as who is taking out these loans currently Right now the crypto space is made up of developers and investors So you are most likely lending your money to one of those two people not too different from real life honestly Developers might take loans to help execute their projects and investors take loans to turn a profit These are secured by being over collateralized basically just saving people money on the fees they would have to pay to convert their currency to something different Investors can also use something called a flash loan that borrows trades and returns money all in a single block These are used in arbitrage and dont actually require collateral feel free to google it if you arent convinced with my 2 sentence description  In a more average joe example someone holding ETH might take out a loan against their ETH to receive some USDC like taking a loan out against your house since ETH is an asset They could then sell that USDC for fiat and use it however they wanted The cool thing is that loans can now be calculated by the minute rather than the day so people can efficiently borrow money to do whatever they need then return it without paying more interest than they need to,0,0,0,1,0

I think for the average person its about cutting out middlemen to offer you better rates and new services enabled by those rates For example if you deposited 10000 into your savings account youd normally get less than 1 yield on that annually Thats because the bank has to cover their costs pay their employees and leave room for profit even though they could be getting anywhere from 3 to 30 on your deposit But what if all that money went to you and you got 15 instead? And now imagine what other possibilities that could enable like What if you could automatically donate a part of that to charity? What if you could use that money to automatically invest in other companiesprojects? What if you could use that yield to automatically payoff purchases so its like you can spend a free 125 every month before it starts being added to your credit card?

My favorite thing about defi is the passive income side My brother got going in crypto relatively early Now through staking and lending working defi he was able to quite the job that he kind of hated and go back to school to become a therapist With the passive income provided on the side its made it possible for him to actually figure out where his true talents are and provide real value to society and this is where I think the real value in defi is going to be Itll allow people to provide labor that is intrinsically valuable to them because they wont be under the steel boot of the financial system Im currently on the same track I know that a bear market looms and so it isnt without risk but I dont think that having zero risk is a good thing I think risk is an important part of humans evolving,1,0,0,1,0

DAOs have a very large problem that needs worked out quickly Most DAOs are not Autonomous by nature rather they rely on multisigs to execute governance decisions Making them neither decentralized nor autonomous What is a DAO? A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization This entity has some similarities to corporate shares but should have a much greater level of autonomy so that there is no reliance on the executive board to execute decisions These systems should allow for automatic dispersal of funds from a treasury wallet to the destination with automatic execution of whatever tasks are needed to fully execute a proposal If a DAO wants to execute on an order to change the code it should be able to happen autonomously No need for manual approvals the ultimate approval has been authorized and there should be no new execution needed Without these systems of true autonomy we have glorified corporate shares or network shares that have no legal backing What does a DAO look like today? The huge problem with the current iteration of DAOs as they are built today is that most DAOs rely on multi signature wallets to do the actual execution of onchain governance There is little to no autonomy Take Arbitrum as an example they had a community spend proposal that failed to pass yet they executed the transaction anyways Thats because the central point of failure was trusting the multisig to execute the will of the community rather than their own The same story can be told for Aragon DAO The the community is in a fight for transparency with the developers of the DAO and are looking to try to attribute value back to the DAO token via a treasury spend but the developers have yet to actually relinquish the treasury to the actual DAO community Therefore there is no Decentralization or autonomy Only an organization utilizing its resources the way the developers think is best What is the best way to solve this issue? I know some projects use formal councils which hold elections to allow for a quasiDAO autonomy But corporations vote in elections to elect a board We need to figure out DAOs before Congress figures out regulation Because most projects claiming to be decentralized or autonomous hold a 58 multisig and that is a massive issue,0,1,1,0,1

Repost Ive jokingly floated the idea of running on a direct democracy ticket for a local election Its gotten stuck in my head though which means it might eventually become more than just a joke Constituents can sign up with the office An email address and simple voter registration verification is enough Backend we create a wallet that holds an NFT and is tied to that email address send them an email with the keys to said wallet Front end we create a website they can login with the email checks to see the NFT is still in the wallet created for them or with web3 login if theyve moved the NFT All decisions that come across my desk are put to a vote in a DAO NFTs are also the governance tokens for the DAO Constituents vote I do their bidding results are recorded and published to the DAO For bonus fun constituents can assign their voting power to any other wallet and revoke it at any time so the burden of participation lies only with those that want it yet can be revoked and adjusted if mini representatives within a jurisdiction arent fulfilling an individuals needs,1,0,0,1,0
We know since 2017 that onchain governance is bullshit Anything that goes beyong some minor finetuning of chain settings cannot possibly work with onchain governance proposals While DAOs could be a great usecase for some specific task or use case onchain governance is not one Why? Because someone has to actually turn the proposals into code That person or team will always have veto powers as they can just refuse to do anything Also unless EVERY single code change gets voted on devs can just ship the code as part of any other releasecleanupupdate irrespective of negative vote outcomes But since 99 of holders dont know shit about programming they are not even knowledgeable to make any informed vote making voting on code PRhypedriven and therefore useless #### Basically DAOs are not a usecase for project governance,0,1,1,0,0
The optimist in me wants a web 3 to succeed in a scenario where we all get privacy again and we get control of our data and we dont have 5 companies literally running how the world works but every time I read about anything web 3 related its all scams money laundering pyramid schemes and more scams,1,1,0,0,1
How can we have privacy on a public blockchain? I cant square that circle,0,1,0,0,1
Ah well you see theyre out there building all of these overly complicated untested privacy protocols which attempt to encrypt data on chain but of course theyll all be hastily coded by developers trying to cash in and completely disinterested in hearing why its a bad idea These things only try to solve massive problems created by blockchains and have no value from a privacy perspective over just protecting your data in traditional ways Well except that theyre just one bug away from complete compromise which could of course result in full irrecoverable data exposure Its an awful dystopian future if theyre successful,0,1,1,0,1
And this is solved by putting all your data is in the public for everyone to see? Web3 isnt a privacy solution Its just a way of storing data so its accessible by everyone,0,1,0,0,1
Im not exactly looking forward to the worst possible version of this but some extremely limited AI making low level decisions on how to carry out governance decisions after theyre democratically voted on could be an interesting way to make them slightly more autonomous than they are now,0,0,0,1,1
How do you reconcile not having a board with expertise for greater autonomy with pardon my French dumb people voting? Its an ageold argument with pure democracy,0,1,0,0,1
I mentioned in another comment that I want there to be a way for people to have a decentralised internet that really does protect privacy Thats where I WANT it to succeed amp#x200B But yes I completely agree The more you dig into web3 it either bolts on crypto to something that doesnt need it or it presents a solution that is worse and more complicated,0,1,0,0,1

 gtscenario where we all get privacy again and we get control of our data and we dont have 5 companies literally running how the world works I dont mean to be glib but you know you have a high degree of control over this already right? You can turn off all tracking in your browser You can use a VPN You can retrieve and delete all of your data in FB Google Apple etc You can tighten your dataprivacy settings in all of them so that they are doing the minimum possible with your data Or you can just not use those services at all Nobody is forcing you to use them Every claim I see about Web 3 that isnt completely bonkers is something that we can achieve today,0,1,0,1,1
Youre right but also want to point out that a lot of web 3 stuff only uses blockchain for payments and authentication In theory that means your wallet ID is your login and payment method and everything else is kept in a traditional encrypted database through something like IPFS that you ultimately have control over So there is no central facebook that can access your data amp#x200B But at the end of the day I think almost all of web 3 is vaporware and is better served like you said with better legislation to ensure privacy,0,1,0,0,1
Well you have to pin your files on IPFS or they can vanish That usually means people use a centralized pinning service like pinata You also lose control over your data when you store it publiclyYou would be much better off using an S3 bucket because it will be there when you need it and gone when you dont,0,1,0,0,1

Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAO A Decentralized Autonomous Organization is an organizational structure run by smart contracts on a blockchain where rules are encoded and enforced automatically Members of a DAO govern it through proposals and voting typically using tokens that represent voting power or ownership This structure aims to eliminate central authorities or intermediaries promoting transparency and direct participation from stakeholders Funds and decisions in a DAO are managed collectively based on the consensus of its members often for purposes like investment governance or community projects Essentially DAOs operate on principles of collective decisionmaking where the code and community consensus dictate actions rather than a traditional hierarchical management,0,0,0,1,0

Dude thats not how any of it works The blockchains dont store the IP address of the transaction sender or receiver The only addresses used are the wallet cryptographic addresses the same kind of addresses that are used in the cryptographic technology that allows me to securely communicate with YouTubes website to send you this comment The technology is called asymmetric cryptography because it uses a pair of keys I have a public and private key and you have a public and private key I can use you public key to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with your private key which only you are supposed to know You can respond by encrypting your message with my public key and then it can only be decrypted by my private key These keys are simply just numbers which are stored as hexadecimal addresses the same kind of hexadecimal addresses used in the cryptocurrencies The IPv6 uses hexadecimal addresses for routing connections through the internet but these hexadecimal addresses have nothing to do with the addresses in cryptocurrencies If you are scared of government figuring out your public address by tying your identity to it there are privacy focused crypto currencies like Monero that uses stealth addresses and ring signatures to make it virtually impossible to track your transactions Haven is a new crypto that takes it a step further and creates private stablecoins on top of Moneros technology and enables you to privately switch between different assets whit a plan to create private tokens for virtually anything Look it up!

 to prove you wrong simply go to pirate Bay on a VPN with ipv6 disabled The ads will still pop up with your region based on your Mac address While I appreciate you explaining diffie helmsn key exchanges and PGP to me Im aware of how it works thats how I came up with my comment by witnessing it To decentralize the web with cryptographic keys there would either need to be a place that vrifis the authenticity of the connection like a YouTube authentification server for logging in to write this comment or a DNS server or TLS certificate organization also centralized or a government issuing ranges of keys based on isp or nearest backbone or satellite or whatever youre connected to It has to be centralized somewhere otherwise youre just going to pollute the web with tons and tons of keys and that will grow exponentially faster than legit content on the web Thats not feasible or sustainable long term,0,1,0,0,1
 exactly what am I wrong about? As I stated that IP addresses are not stored on the blockchain that is correct It is indeed possible for the node runners to keep track of the IP addresses connecting to them and ordering a transactions but most of the transactions they will get the info from other nodes so it would take a large actor to gather than kind of data While true that once your device ID is connected with crypto currency address they can see the transaction history from that address that alone wont tell them much They would have to ID the other addresses your transacting with too Despite all this they can only do this with public blockchains there are privacy focused ones like Monero and Haven where you cannot see who is sending money to who or how much anyone has Further there are options like onion routing VPNs and secure browsers I dont know exactly what went wrong in your example of pirate bay but my guess is you did not use a secured browser and the cookies gave away your MAC address Sometimes they dont even use such addresses to ID you but other data points you leak like screen resolutions installed extinctions and other settings etc The solution to such breaches of privacy and data mining is to further obfuscate and use secure browser software About your piece on cryptographic certificates authenticity having to be centralized I counter with this project ,0,1,0,1,1
U hmmm even the ISPs are not Centralized! Concentrated? Yes Centralized? No! Anyone can choose to be an ISP but it doesnt mean they can accomplish it Yes the ISPs are powerful and monopolistic when the comes to scaling access to the internet but thats a different matter entirely,0,1,0,1,0
Yep youre right about the problem of scalability and sustainability which is why there is a lot of crypto projects out there if youre interested you can dive more about the approaches they use to tackle them Also blockchain is not ready yet for social media it is currently developed around transactions So we dont have any concrete examples to discussions around web3 social media Lastly keep in mind as a client you dont need to store the blockchain For example Bitcoin is currently at 300GB You dont need to store anything if you just want to make a transaction unless you want to participate as the node in the network in which you are indeed incentivized to store them because you can receive some token if youre selected to continue the blockchain which justifies having to pay for the electricity and storage etc,0,1,0,1,0

This video is actually very misleading in the sense that it uses a buzz word from the tech industry but doesnt even come close to doing the topic justice 1 Tokens are already in use for companies like LVMH who is the parent company of Louis Vuitton fine wine and many luxury goods They use it to ensure every item has a unique blockID on the blockchain in order to maintain authenticity throughout the supply chai process and prevent counterfeiting Technology currently being developed for web 3 is intended to address issues such as slow transaction speed and electricity usage by tech such as bitcoin and Ethereum As someone who has watched the crypto market since 2017 I can say almost 90 of the tokens available for investment is a scam so be careful However the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is very solid and can be used for things like smart contracts There are currently pilot projects in some African countries which uses smart contracts for small loans insurance and even voting 2 The way web 3 works is a bit different than say apps you download from the playstore as web 3 apps can be updated and bugs can be fixed without user permission or the user even needing to do anything These things will be in the terms of use for these apps and is the way forward as it makes everyones lives a lot easier I get hoe this sounds like users are losing control but its actually quite a tedious and annoying task to have to keep on updating apps and OS given how much we rely on our devices for daily use Hope this helps and thanks for asking these questions,0,1,0,1,1
First question its just like people where collecting stamps or shoes now they can collect something that anaybody can easily forge I dont get the point apart saying you own an original The problem with Web3 is that if trully decentralized then data is stored on chain For privacy data is encrypted But what you encrypted today will almost certainly be decryptable at some point in the future So Im very doubtful of anything big happening Few use case where it has proven useful land registry in a corrupt country The Gov kept record of land ownership on blockchain People could trust this system to not be corrupt because it was transparent So really only useful for public data,0,1,0,0,1

One BTC is over 68k and has not gone below 60 k in months When I bought in the price of one bitcoin was abt 2300 an INSANE price people said ETH was 60 and years later I bought SOL at about 13 Ive never experiences a loss of what I put in I studied carefully how to buy in and also what crypto is and what it can and cant do Even if I had paid 3x that id still be very far ahead People ask Yeah but what can you do wit? What does it create? The answer mostly at present is wealth Ive also used it to send money and its def nice to be able to send 1000 and pay a 3 fee instead of a 50 fee at the bank It is precisely how unstable it is and its more stable now that ever at least for the time being that makes it great to speculate on For me anyway its been the easiest money Ive ever made not that Im a millionaire or have a lambo wouldnt want one I do have kickass motorcycle I love but i dont have to worry about money  which is pretty major bc i was so bad at saving when I was younger,1,0,0,1,0

 This just makes it clear that you dont understand nothing about Blockchain First of all being unsafe is laughable because your money in the bank is at way more risk than in a crypto wallet due to it being impossible to hack And no it doesnt do nothing as you said because it has instant transfer speeds and no fees or having to go through a middleman like a bank Crypto is just better,0,1,1,0,0

The only thing bad about fiat currency is when its controlled by a weak state Inflation reduces the effective interest rate on debt for countries and makes borrowing easier which makes investments in infrastructure easier to profit from People end up with more raw value than if their money never changed relative to what they can buy since theyre able to earn interest from investments faster than inflation is able to eat at their money The best state will assure that the inflation rate of their currency is less than the interest rate that you could earn on a normal investment but also higher than interest on stateowned debt,1,1,0,0,0

Yes it is true that it isnt viable as a mainstream currency while it is still volatile It can be used as a currency though I accept bitcoin as payment when mixing music in my studio for example if I want to I can exchange the bitcoin for some other currency the moment I get the payment meaning any volatility is effectively irrelevants ince the value doesnt typically change significantly over an hour Also on average Bitcoin increases in value rather than drops in value so the volatility isnt a bad thing if you average it over a large set of transactions Anyway the idea is that itd work as a curency if it becomes more adopted than it currently is I dont know when or if thatll happen and perhaps Bitcoin isnt the answer but rather some other cryptocurrency perhaps one that hasnt even been made yet Perhaps Bitcoin will remain digital gold as it was mainly intended rather than becoming digital cash,0,1,0,1,0
 Yeah anyone can look at the historical price chart of Bitcoin and be unable to argue that it was a bad idea to invest in it at least longerterm Im personally up about 20x on my investment into Bitcoin I dont get how anyone can pretend to laugh at those who argued your should buy Bitcoin 510 years ago when the fact is that they were right and you would indeed have made a lot of money if you bought it The crypto bros were right,1,1,0,0,0

 You lost me I didnt say anything about international governments or a paper version of anything so not sure what you mean Im saying Bitcoin relies on consensus and consensus can be forced with threats The main reason it hasnt been banned is they know if it ever gets big enough they can just force consensus any way they want and most people will go along,0,1,0,0,1

 Im not sure if were talking about the same things You seem to be referring to things unrelated to the original #2 point you disputed that the gov has enough power to force the majority into consensus and the majority lacks the desire to fight back You seem to be thinking that what makes a coin centralized and therefore controllable by the gov is being proof of stake But there are many things that can make a coin centralized A proof of stake coin or of work can be centralized or decentralized Thats beside the point My point is that even a decentralized coin can be controlled or taken over by a gov or by anyone good at controlling people in terms of the majority of the population will go along with whatever miners will patch their software in accordance with laws and most people will use the legal wallets if it came to that Thats a fatal flaw,0,1,0,0,1

I think there was an incorrect claim about bitcoin mining energy consumption if its widely adopted Presumably due to a popular paper published in Nature entitled Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2C which sigh  ok the following is from memory and its been a while so if you actually care about specifics go check the source The ermagerd boiling the oceans paper was wrong because it Misinterpreted how mining works its purpose pertinently the relationship between hashing extreme bingo or whatever and transactions Then did a simple extrapolation maintaining the current at the time ratios between transaction rate network hash rate energy consumption and CO2e per unit of energy produced Thus calculated figures which describe a truly terrifying hypothetical future scenaroio which fortunately were also absurd preposterous outthegate due to the combination of wrong assumptions and exponential functions How TF did it pass peer review? I dont know The simplest clue If someone talks about a proof of work blockchains change in energy consumption over time in terms of units of energy per transaction they have probably been misinformed which happens a lot because theres a whole lot of bs out there It doesnt really matter though Bitcoins energy consumption is indisputably Quite High And it will continue regardless And even if it didnt humanitys demand for energy will remain pinned at MAXIMUM regardless of literally anything apparently Also Ive been around crypto for years and years no not evil nor extremely stupid another thing not covered by the video  and this video I dont entirely agree with all the points and there are some SOME goodhopefulusefulnotterribleimproving things which werent covered  but the vast majority of the things she said about the things she talked about are true It is indeed a wretched dosh pit of scum and villainy Anyway As for the climate apocalypse humanity seems to have firmly decided not to save itself so either 1 AI will fix it or 2 Nuclear winter will fix it and then the people if any who dont get irradiated or starve to death or get murdered and eaten by the irradiated starving hordes will either be a ready to start gathering sticks and stones for WW4 or b doomed to extinction due to runaway heating without the knowledge or tools to do anything about it just perhaps the weight of knowing that we could have but we fked it all up or c both! or 3 AI will kill us all and we wont have to worry about climate change killing us all anyway yay!

 Blockchain removes the need for singleparty middlemen authentication which is a big deal when it comes to streamlining processes drastically reducing cost expanding scalability and improving security Blockchain is being used in supplychain tracking because manufacturers and retail outlets can rely on tens of thousands of companies for the supplying transportation and distribution of items and goods Blockchain services allow for all parties to participate equally in the tracking process letting the blockchain manage the verification of transition points between vendors over the lifetime of a product starting from production all the way to being sold in the store This makes it significantly easier for all parties including end customers to integrate with and transparently assess and audit the transition of goods throughout the supply chain Walmart as an example rolled out a blockchain integration for their Canadian supplychain tracking just a couple of years ago and its already saved them millions of dollars in reducing vendor disputes The fundamental improvements blockchain provides are clear to everyone working in enterprise software development As I mentioned earlier some of the largest corporations and global fortune 500 companies in the world are integrating with andor providing services in the blockchain space The only people who dont see its value are largely leftleaning drama channels that dislike finance bruhs and want to capitalize on sensational news stories without considering an iota of broader context,1,0,0,1,0

 I am a bitcoin trader Selling Bitcoin is what I do for a living Here are the reasons I am given when a buyer whats to sell to me You tell me which ones of those reasons are invalid I need fiat to pay bills In 2022 the price was at 65k and I expect it to correct down That is it Those are the only two reasons ever given to me for selling bitcoin If you knew anything about Bitcoin you would want to buy it and never sell unless you really have to And many do just that,0,1,1,0,0
 First of all there are various reasons for my clients to buy Bitcoin Some buy it to buy something else on the internet some buy it as an investment some buy it as a form of savings account of wealth protection Some buy it to gamble on the internet And I am sure I forget other reasons to buy Bitcoin But none of that matters You claim I sell bitcoin because I dont believe in Bitcoin or because Im dumping it But that is stupid Its like saying your banker will exchange your USD for some Euro proves that your banker doesnt believe in the USD I sell Bitcoin with a 3 markup And I also buy Bitcoin with a 3 mark down In between those two I make a profit which I use to increase my Bitcoin holdings Only a really stupid person would twist that into meaning that I dont believe in Bitcoin,0,1,1,0,0

 Here is my experience with fraud buyer contacts me and wants to buy with email money transfer He shows me his face on video holding his ID proving that he is the legit account holder He sends me the email money transfer payment and I send him the Bitcoin Two days later  I get a call from the bank telling me the payment was fraudulent The guy was using someone elses bank log in with fake ID on video The is obviously a bank security problem The bank did not protect their clients money properly shame on the bank The client did not protect his login properly shame on him And the fraud is just a fraud shame on him But me? I am the only one who did my job I sold bitcoin and I did my best to make sure the buyer was not a fraud Thought weeding out frauds should not be part of my job Its the banks job to protect your money not my job But the moment that the bank finds out I was selling Bitcoin for that payment it suddenly becomes a bitcoin fraud and the bank declares its all my fault So yeah I know exactly what fraud is because banks try to blame me for their bank frauds all the time,0,0,1,0,1

USER But you dont obtain digital property In the case of NFTs ownership has absolutely no basis in actual law You dont own copyright over it Someone else can copyright the NFT you own and sue you for using it ,0,1,0,0,1
USER he is right though you made a whole 2 fucking paragraphs about how munecat could mint this video and get money from it but as USER said she cannot claim the copyright of this video on NFTs because court still does not see blockchain as a vaild copyright Even then if they see it it still makes no sense because blockchain is supposed to be anonymous right? if mnecat abolishes her anonmity then the entire point of blockchain is lost Blockchains big innovations are that it is anonymous cannot be hacked and cannot be changed But to enforce copyright you cannot be anonymous so your first innovation is useless Second one is not also true it is not safe at all you can get phished by a random smart contract and you lose your NFTs 3rd one is the only true thing you cannot change anything minted directly onto it but people still put links instead of direct source so people can overcome from this change aswell So all in all blockchain is different but it is actually not And the other guy said this multiple times you cannot enforce copyright without a higher power The reason why somebody cannot point a gun to my face and take my home is because i live in a country with power to undo that crime Even if mnecat tries to mint this video and gain money from it somebody has to recognize it If I steal it and reupload it you cannot remove it from the blockchain or put me in jail because a nation has to recognize the blockchain is the patenting system they are going to use Now even if they use blockchain as the database why would they do that? it is less secure than a countrys database because it is open to everybody and I dont want my medical records or my title deed to be seen by everybody it is against my privacy The last thing is that the guy you were arguing with put it very well you need to be violent to make people behave Even if I made a law that said killing people is punished by execution if I dont have the police to force that onto people it will not stick So for your blockchain copyright to stick there needs to be a group controlling it Maybe you want this to be a private company aswell but they can be corrupt so you need someone higher to investigate them but maybe ones investigating them are also corrupt so you need someone investigating them aswell Well governments work so that this cycle doesnt go forever Maybe you can say that governments are corrupt and you are true for many countries but at least you can point to some countries that actually work,0,1,1,0,1

 Blockchains adoption is growing up and going as fast and even faster than other techs of the past Moreover crypto is not dead as you pretend You probably read a shitty article in some weird economic journal for boomers The value of the total market grows in cycles which means that the money investors comes and goes The crash we had last year is least worst than the one of the 3 previous cycles which indicates that the asset is becoming stronger When the market is in an upward cycle new actors emerge when in a down cycle some of them die because their product were shit Normal process In the next 24 months youll see BTC and the total market value reaching new all time highs with even more people and companies coming in and youll tell to yourself what ??

 Blockchains are not just ledgers that cant be edited its the way in which they cant be edited The important bit is that their entries can be continually verified as unadulterated without central authority or central servers and can be used to keep track of damn near anything just like a traditional database The decentralized verification capabiliy that is baked into the implementation of the technology is what has revolutionary potential Wouldnt you want more p2p option for data and logistics management in a situation where a fascist state was cracking down on leftists movements? Blockchain fits in thst space Need a way to track a nonmonetary resource allocation system across any given area at any time without needing to centralize that information? Blockchain van be used for that and allow for accurate tracking of transactions at the same time These are just two examples As for the environmental destruction argument its whatabboutism when compared to the rest of industrial capitalism The current financial system and the PC gaming market both produce more environmental destruction each than the crypto space and yes thats counting big hitting bitcoin farm warehouses in china Youre arbitrarily singling out blockchain tech for derision when really its the entire fossil fuel grid thats the problem Dont let yourself be manipulated into opposing an entire technology simply because halfeducated commentators with flashy production value content have played upon your emotions and outrage at oilera capitalism as a whole,1,0,0,1,0

 Just want to clarify that you intentionally misquoted me at the end there What is special about blockchain is not that it is an immutable ledger but rather that the reason the ledger is immutable is because it is decentralized Thats the important part Usually records of any kind need to have a trusted central authority in control of the ledger in order to ensure it remains unchanged Blockchain is a system that doesnt require this in principle which is a big deal Its an example of a technology implementation that is native to a philosophy of statelessness This development is highly relevant to leftists Also your attacks from the environmental angle continue to ring hollow given that youre conveniently ignoring how all the data processing on the internet is all currently bad and in many cases worse because of fossil fuels You also bizarrely dismiss out of hand the idea that energy efficiency will improve which is especially bizzare given that energy usage efficiency increases will need to be an essential part of combating climate change and transition to a renewable carbon neutral grid By your logic leftists should just stop using the internet and electricity in general I really think you should calm down and ask yourself what youre really angry about I promise you its not blockchain tech in and of itself because that wouldnt make any sense to hate a software datastructre I think what youre angry about is financial grift which is not a problem that is specific to blockchain as a technology It is however specific to capitalism So to attack blockchain as a tech with such vitriol seems like an unfair displacement of anger onto the real enemy which is the bourgeois capitalist system,0,1,0,1,1

 actually thats completely false The scientific paper which stated the fact that crypto is harmful to the environment is heavily disputed and most of the energy consumption of a crypto such as bitcoin is generated through green energy or wasted energy offshoots from oil plants wasted energy as in energy generated from these operations which cannot be transported elsewhere and are instead just burned Crypto miners pay oil companies for this energy for super cheap as its energy that was just going to get wasted regardless Crypto is actually greener than paper money ironically,0,1,0,0,0
 it was disputed by other researchers working for the same publication because of blatant factual errors Particularily relating to their calulations of emissions based off of outdated data from 2017 when ASICs were still a new technology and hadnt been optimized for energy efficiency as well as a misinterpretation as to how blockchains use energy The original paper seems to make a connection between transactions and energy output something that doesnt make any sense as transactions get pushed to blocks no matter how much energy is being used it takes energy to mine a block but you can record pretty much as many transactions in it as you want this misinterpretation is why you see talk show hosts and mainstream media outlets saying that if Bitcoin stays at its current popularity its gonna raise global temperatures by like 05c or something stupid despite the fact that no matter how popular Bitcoin gets it wont be using that much more power as it is now due to the power use per block reward cap on mining and its likely going to fall a bit since miners have the incentive to use as little energy as possible to minimize costs of running their machines,0,1,1,1,0

 blockchains allow for that append only functionality to be validated by the emergent network as a whole rather than by a mutuallytrusted central authority Thats whats importantly different about it Its a particular application of an append only ledger that is native to a stateless environment because it does not need central authority validation which means that its a technology implementation that is of particular relevance to the larger leftist project of creating a classless stateless society I mean have you thought about this for example using crypto tokens as labor vouchers? No? probably because youve been propagandized into believing that everything related to crypto is automatically sus including the underlying tech itself because some attention hungry bread tuber said cyrpto bad a thought terminating cliche while what theyre really doing is using it as a whipping boy for capitalism as a whole This is unfair to blockchain tech and how it can function in ways removed from capitalist usage,1,0,0,1,0

Forget the currency part for a moment and think blockchain the underlying technology Which is at its simplest an alternative to using databases This comes with some advantages for some situations and is already being used in some industries shipping healthcare inventory financial Toyota is using it for a new autopilot system for example Its not necessarily better for everything The way it works is a network is distributed among great multitudes of computers not just ones owned by a company Theres a reward for contributing and a fee for using and the currency is the medium of exchange So think currency of a network not a nation not trying to replace the dollar In that sense investing in a crypto is kinda like buying a stock Well  kind of like buying the riskiest stock except way more risky lol This video is mostly correct factually but the snark arrogance and negativity rub me the wrong way Its not like no one else sees the negatives and minefields its that some folks try to navigate through and get some positive things out of it,1,1,0,1,0

 While I appreciate the long and comprehensive answer there is one crucial mistake in there You assume that I support the LN in its entirety without doubts of any sort which is not the case While I agree that LN is not that good of a solution I wouldnt be as cynical as you about it but whatever Nothing stands or falls with it The very reason why I mentioned LN is for people who only know about base layer transactions to be able to imagine how the layered approach works That is one of the crucial distinctions between BTC and most altcoins I dont have to worry too much about specific solutions on upper layers as last as the base layer is solid Upper layers can always be replaced by more viable solutions The problem with altcoins is that they try to do everything in the base layer and inevitably run into unsolvable problems Even the few honest altcoins are victim of the monolith mentality Just as with LN you make other assumptions that are not true For instance I dont believe we are all going to be rich My aim is not to get rich off of BTC but to take away the money printer from any single entity I agree tho that CoffeeZilla is not nearly cynical enough but I assume thats just part of his presentation model that he may believe could help overcome cognitive dissonance in folks who believe a scammer and I do believe that that is a good approach for somebody in his position,0,1,0,1,0

I think we can agree there are some people who have better intentions and more competance than others when given responsibility over infrastructure that were all dependent on The current system of power is arbitrary imperfect and occasionally even sinister corrupt and I think many believe all that is necessary to fix these problems is to simply break subvert said system and allow another new and arbitrary one to take its place Unfortunately many people are very suggestible and lacking discernment So when an opportunity for shift of power arises many are overeager and overconfident in placing said power in the hands of other incompetant or illintented people who are able win over their trust with superficial and baseless talking points How do we ensure responsible delivery of power to those who will use it to better the condition of the world? Maybe we can focus on cultivating improvement of the populaces skills in discernment and critical thought Or perhaps its the responsibility of those who possess the needed competance insight and good intentions themselves to create new infrastructure that instrinsically renders all competing and harmful infrastructure obsolete Though that is almost always an uphill battle when those people possess very little power and resources,0,1,0,1,1
Mining is literally the process by which the Bitcoin network confirms new transactions attempting to split mining from the equation when comparing the energy footprint per transaction is beyond disingenuous you do not get the one thing without also having the other,0,1,0,0,1
 Miners can Purchase bitcoins on the exchange market Accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services Mine new bitcoins The last task is the really hard one I was not talking about mining new ones,0,0,0,1,0
 And I am telling you that people doing that last task is in fact the very mechanism by which the network determines that any of the preceding tasks have actually happened or not you cannot divorce the mechanism by which a chain achieves consensus from the equation when computing the energy requirements of transactions on a chain The ludicrously energy intensive process of mining that creates wasted duplicate work and scales up the more processing power is devoted towards it is intrinsic to how transactions work with Bitcoin and its why the average energy usage per single transaction on the network is currently what an average US household consumes over the course of 718 ENTIRE DAYS Its quite abundantly clear why youd want to strip away the mining component when presenting figures but thats using numbers to tell lies as its a meaningless distinction the one thing only happens because the other is also happening You cannot cannot divorce the two and pretend they are not linked unless you are being a liar,0,1,0,0,1
 Ive got a question that bugs my mind that you might know the answer to mining was low energy at the beginning and could be done on a weak processor Is the complexity level a factor of the infinite growth of the ledger or it has been tweaked by the developers to increase difficulty and cost?,0,0,0,1,1
 Its neither actually the increase in complexity isnt directly tied to the exponential growth of the ledger over time though of course that raises its own host of issues or the result of a tweak but rather the direct result of an automated system that been present since Bitcoins inception in order to ensure that new blocks are discovered at roughly the same rate the difficulty is adjusted upwards or downwards based on how many miners are competing to discover blocks The more resources are being directed towards the task the harder that task gets in other words you cant realistically compete with a normal run of the mill CPU these days like you could in Bitcoins infancy because most of those miners competing now are just entire mobile datacenters of specialized singletask computers built specifically for that purpose all controlled by 1 particularly rich asshole competing against the other particularly rich assholes with their own mobile datacenters of specialized singletask computers roving around the globe seeking out cheap electricity to power them For the difficulty to ever scale back down all of those guys would first have to stop competing in that manner because they are competing like that and constantly building bigger and better rigs with which to compete the difficulty never scales back down Addressing that aspect of Bitcoin would require hardforking the chain to change the code,0,1,0,0,1
 its really great to cross paths with someone that is generous of his time like you as a developer myself now Im even more motivated to dig in that type of code I havent officially looked into it yet only skimmed the surface of it all its actually pretty cool that it autoregulates itself I was wondering why the variations of effort!,1,0,0,1,0
 Yeah its intentionally meant to mimic the mining process for precious metals like gold hence the name where the hardermore intensely you work a particular seam of ore the more involved the process gets and its an interesting way to disincentivize someone from attempting to take over the network by just building a bigger machine via that mechanism of diminishing returns at least in theory but the problem with that approach in practice is that when you pair it with the winner takes all aspect of the validation process that Bitcoin uses what you actually get is a set of perverse structural incentives as a Bitcoin miner if youre someone who can afford to throw vast amounts of processing power at the task its now in your best interests to do that even though that ramps the difficulty up immensely as a response to you doing that because that increase in difficulty now realistically lowers the pool of your actual competition to validate new blocks from basically anyone on the planet with a CPU to just the other dudes like you with those enormous mining rigs The returns might be diminishing but theyre still returns and youre more likely to get them now It leads to a scenario where its still hard for any one individual to take effective control but the pool of mining systems and thus validation nodes competing as mnecat humorously put it in that game of extreme bingo has shrunk something fierce and thanks to that winner takes all aspect of the validation process the electrical waste gets ramped up to the point of absurdity with no prize for 2nd place or below and no actual point to any the work being done except to win by doing it you wind up with a system that consumes as much power annually as Thailand thats spending it mostly to produce nothing Hence why Bitcoin apologists tend to either find ways to not discuss the real cost per transaction when the topic arises or try to flip the script and argue that the extreme electrical waste isnt actually waste at all you see because its serving the purpose of securing the network so its actually a GOOD thing that Bitcoin consumes as much energy as Thailand though for obvious reasons of optics they dont make that particular comparison directly in their arguments Theyre not particularly convincing because its easy to see that that is ridiculous I think the main reason Bitcoin dodges more criticism than you would expect to be leveled at it for how it operates is that while its widely known to be immensely energy intensive theres this perception by people who havent scrutinized just what the mining process entails that it MUST be doing something useful with all that energy beyond just playing games of extreme bingo with it that surely all the computational resources being consumed arent just getting frittered away bruteforce guessing the answers to meaningless cryptographic math equations that are only there to be solved in the first place to be a speed bump that the work cant possibly just be entirely pointless and worthless on its own but thats precisely what it is a speed bump thats just meant to keep the block discovery rate pinned at roughly 1 block discovered per every 10 minutes of mining and make it impractical to execute 51 attacks,0,1,0,0,1
 The first minute and a half is complete nightmare fantasy priming the the uninitiated viewer to view crypto negatively right from the start Her explaination of Blockchain is terrible and doesnt actually explain what Blockchain is or how it works Zero mention of cryptography Right there is when I knew this was BS Crypto currency has become the standard currency for refugees Ask any Russian who has recently fled Russia This has also been the case for much of the global south who do not have access to banks but have access to the internet People in the western world forget that there are places where the government can decide to just take your money or go belly up financially over night im not on their side but those truckers in Canada have their bank accounts frozen and they were able to continue to fund their operations thanks to crypto Crypto protects those people Millions of people in countries all over the world To say theres no need for it because visa is faster is absolutely ridiculous wrong and dangerous Then we have the broad argument that it uses more power than the Netherlands while making no mention of the electricity and man power required to run our current monitory system Brick and mortar Banks all over the world dont run on hopes and dreams They use electricity Its completely one sided argument its not nuanced in the slightest I cant even watch past this point a second time  Literally just the most negative uninformed BS someone can come up with or cherry picked from the headlines of anti crypto articles Also the last time I checked before crypto all crime and criminals used 100 Fiat currency so its not like Crypto has cornered the market on funding crime In fact to this day the majority of financial crimes still uses legacy methods cash wires transfers etcand thats just the first 5 minutes My real problem with this is that its irresponsible To discuss this in such a hyper sensationalized and biased way and presenting that to hundreds of thousands of people who may know no better is just irresponsible and can do a lot of harm For what?

 I just thought exploring what the Blockchain is at its core would be thoughtful A glorified appendonly database is what blockchain is at its core all the additional complexity layered over that bog simple and entirely nonsexy premise is purely the result of the unconventional method for how new entries are added and verified the system operating as it does in an entirely bass ackward fashion under a set of constraints that a rational DBA would not impose Its just a database where each successive entry block relies on all previous entries the chain hence the name theres really nothing revolutionary about it when you boil it down to what it is that the system actually does The people who push the narrative that blockchain is this enormously impactful technological innovation thats going to shape the very course of history that blockchain is the future are a bunch of grifters or delusional techbros enamored with decentralization for entirely irrational reasons Its just a database what if any real applications would actually justify implementing that particular manner of database to accomplish is a thing that remains to be seen because blockchain has been a solution perpetually in search of a problem since its inception the reality is that basically everything that you can make a blockchain do is something you could do better with a normal database and central servers except for crime,0,1,1,0,0

No problems with said leaders controlling the currency print rate? No problems with them having the power to issue an executive order that bypasses laws to freeze or seize bank accounts effectively taking away all of your wealth stored in their currency? Another way to look at it is would you rather put your faith in people being fully aware of the many human flaws that are innate to each individual greed being prime among them or math which reliably carries out a predictable algorithm that is completely open sourced and auditable? Think about your answer and then take a moment to consider how youd explain that answer to a citizen of Venezuela who has essentially lost all their wealth to a hyperinflated currency and has such a corrupt and politically inept government that theyd rather keep their citizens holding that failing currency than saving their wealth in an asset that is a far better store of value While its true that many people are treating Bitcoin like a get rich quick scheme theres far more to this protocol and what it represents than just that It has REAL provable utility right in the here and now for not just millions but BILLIONS of individuals whore each bleeding tens of percent of their wealth away to inflation In many cases such as in North Korea they arent even allowed to use or spend most of the money in their bank accounts Theyre literally incapable of moving their wealth into another currency or asset! Call it illegal in their case if youd like as if doing something considered illegal to an evil cartel is really a bad thing in the first place but I foresee a future in which many North Koreans decide to adopt Bitcoin as their preferred currency to receive their income and therefore work around those draconian laws and joke of an economy that exists in that corner of the world and thousands others like it Because as much as those corrupt leaders would like to stop their unfortunate victims from sending and receiving that digital currency they simply dont have the power to stop it because they cant control what transactions go through that blockchain,1,1,0,0,1

Sorry for my english There are lots of reasons for having a decentralized asset that is globabally recognized trusted and accepted The reason bitcoin has value is purely a social construct Anyone can make a copy of bitcoin and many have but none of them take off because they lack the trust and network effect that bitcoin already has People want what they believe others want and they put value on things based on how much they perceive others to want it Let me give you some examples of other social constructs that are very powerful Religion Islam Christianity etc luxury brands Mercedes BMW design etc These social constructs are selfreinforcing and only become stronger with time unless civilization gets some kind of hard reset If you happen to be or live in a politically unstable country that wants to confiscate your wealth for whatever reason to make war or fix the economy etc how do you extractprotect your wealth if the usual channels are shut? The bank will not allow you to withdraw or send the money abroad You cant take your house with you Gold will easily get confiscated at the airport Stocks will get taken easily or are being devalued by the government Your best bet is to buy the most stable decentralized digital asset It just happens to be bitcoin that is the most stable of all of these tokens I am not claiming bitcoin to be perfect but I would rather store my wealth in bitcoin for a few years than in any other new green bitcoin clone that may or may not be accepted by people Decentralized currenciesstores of value can also boost international trade by breaking a lot of barriers I am sure it will have lots of unintended consequences that we may not even know about now But There is no way to stop it Sure we can dampen the price by banning trading etc but that will not really stop the My prediction for the long term future is that governments will go bankrup and lose powert because the economy will slowly go underground with anonymous cryptocurrencies It will have many bad consequences but probably even more good ones,1,1,0,1,0

 You are assuming crypto is decentralised which is counterfactual Coins are controlled by a vast minority of people its even worse than fiat at that and is painfully easy to manipulate as proven by Elon Musk blatantly saying he would accept Bitcoin on his Teslas then promptly dumping his stock after it jumped in price and jumping ship And as said in Line Goes Up Ethereum has been forked and people are now using the fork You know the one centrally decided to be the true one not the more principled one The point was never that decentralisation is bad just that it doesnt work Crypto isnt decentralised and has led in a very short time may I add to an absurd level of centralisation Its literally a worse system for most of us just by virtue of that But the lower tier ie most of crypto bros will take all the hopium they can in an attempt to get to be the new 1 Everything else is propaganda,0,1,0,0,1

 It depends Some blockchain protocols can support a very large number of transactions with no additional power needed Some would require more power and some only support a limited number of transactions regardless of how much power you put into them But they are all software based so they can be easily changed to increase throughout or simplify mining if needed Changing code is a lot easier and cheaper than changing the way global banking works It doesnt matter what you and I think Either blockchain technology will replace traditional banks or they wont Im fine either way The important lesson is to be open minded and flexible so that if a paradigm change occurs you can quickly and easily adapt The world may change and it wont bother to check with you before it does,1,0,0,1,0

 Even you admit they dont prefer it they are just doing it because it pays the bills Its tedious and as soon as the NFTs stop being worth money the people doing the grinding quit playing as is happening to Axie Infinity right now The people doing the grinding know its shit and theyre being exploited its not a matter of preference NFT games are miserable experiences,0,0,1,0,1
 Yes exactly Which is why NFT games will actually become a massive hit at some point because the prospect of making more money playing a game over going to work is too good,1,0,0,1,0
Theres another problem too If youre getting money out of your game it must mean someone else is putting it in Usually new players The business model is very close to that of a ponzi scheme For anyone to profit the game must constantly be expanding luring in new players who will put money in and those will expect to eventually get it out again so even more new players are needed Its sustainable only so long as the game is constantly growing at an everincreasing rate and that cannot last,0,1,0,0,1
 This is never going to happen NFT play to earn games by the design of How NFTs and that pay scheme work will always require new money to go in to the system It requires an infinite supply of more money from more people to fuel the revenue Thats not sustainable Where does the money come from?

Cashing out crashes the value so someone a bunch of someones will get caught holding the bag Theres no way to make it a reliable source of income Even if it does work why the fuck would you ever wish to partake in such a thing? You think league of legends is toxic now or insert any other game because of imaginary mmr points?

can someone explain how NFTs are money laundering?,0,1,0,0,1
Im starting to work in web 3 too I think the video is cool and I agree NFTs are really the sinister part of crypto but calling Web3 all a scam is a bit of a stretch to be honest There are some legitimate projects that make sense,1,1,0,1,0
 basically people will create an NFT and mint it with one wallet Then theyll artificially pump the price of the NFT with laundered money that is in crypto with another wallet by buying their own NFT at a huge price so once the NFT is sold that crypto is now legitimate money that can be exchanged in a exchange and transferred in a bank Now because peoples identity are anonymous its hard to tell if someone is purchasing their own NFT and inflating the price Now its not 100 certain that the huge prices of alot of these NFTs are caused by this behaviour but many people speculate this is the reason some random NFTs are valued so much and I wouldnt be surprised if its true tbh,0,1,0,0,1

 Thanks to Munecats superb explanation I can tell you Back in the day a rich person would get their income taxed by the government to fund schools hospitals police libraries etc etc But they didnt want to be taxed Because theyre greedy and selfish So they bought artworks  paintings some of them extremely precious their bank statements seemed meagre They could be living in a mansion on Rhode Island with apparently not a dime to be taxed extremely poor people living in a castle with an exceptional collection of artwork! As Munecat shows us NFTs are digital artworks another way to dodge taxes just like the rest of crypto  guess what Putins new preferred currency is?

Im not sure you understand what an NFT is You seem to strictly be talking about people selling digital only art as NFTs That is literally just a small part of what NFTs are and the potential of NFTs Really NFTs are just blockchain tech Your not buying some fictional fantasy piece of art Your buying a representation of something real Whether thats a house a time share a literal physical piece of art or a digital piece of art partial ownership of a business or literally hundreds if not ifinite use cases Its no different then paying cash for these things only it acts a proof of ownership and certificate of authenticity when it comes to things like art collectibles etc Its just a ledger If you dont want to pay money for a piece of strictly digital art then dont some people want to thats their choice But thats literally a irrelevant part of what NFTs are,0,1,0,1,0
 with all due respect what the hell do you know Your info source is lefty youtubers Im not saying buying crypto is even a good idea its inherently risky but a decentralized settlement layerglobal computer was never possible in history until now and it has big implications Ignoring that out of an instinctive response to crypto douches makes you as dumb as them,0,1,1,0,0
there are plenty of crypto protocols that bring value to the ecosystem that are not abbot belief,0,0,0,1,0
Belief and trust is required for currency to win as a currency but belief and trust do not a currency make Everyone could believe and trust in my belly button lint but if I can flood the market with it than it will fail Hardness in a couple areas makes a currency viable Then and only then can you start convincing people to use it Crypto has the potential to be the hardest currency in history Its not perfect It is a risk But a risk that a lot of richer and smarter not bro kind of people have taken and its not for no reason,1,1,0,0,0
 What do you mean by hardness? As in oposed to liquidity? The rich have taken the risk because the potential payoff is worldchanging which isnt to say that it is a better system Just that it would benefit them I encourage you to question whether or not something that is especifically selected to be good for rich people is a good thing for the rest of us On the other hand the smart people selling NFTs are saying some of the stupidest shit in order to make themselves richer Not really something that would benefit smart people in the long term,0,1,0,0,1
 Oh so it has to do with stability Not really part of the rest of my point but interesting to know the terminology nonetheless On the point of hardness though its still not practically aplicable even if some believe it has theorethical potential As shown by the likes of Elon Musk its extremely easy to manipulate a decentralised market and essentially make it act like a centralised one by virtue of being subdued to the small minority that owns the most currency The only way to prevent that is by introducing regulations which make it more centralised by whoever decides those regulations Its either the anarchist commune being taken over by the monarchy next door or someone getting more power by either luck or natural capacity then consolidating it and essentially replicating centralisation Its one of those things that could be solvable but the historical reality demands proof before we jump into a promised solution,0,1,0,0,1
 Hence the hardness of gold It resists manipulation by nature without the need for regulation Theres really no centralized body that regulates the value of gold Taxes or fees for trading and investing arent regulations Although governments have confiscated peoples gold in the past US circa 1933 among others another reason crypto has potential because it would be difficult for governments to come take it Adding to its potential hardness across time,1,1,0,0,0
 I didnt just say taxes Also market manipulation Both of those are enforced by centralised control systems that regulate how transactions work and can potentially punish people with a lot of moneypower trying to make the price go up or down Crypto could potentially find a market there I used to say it has potential as a gold replacement but thus far that can only be done with a centralised system to fight market manipulation Which kinda already happened with the EthereumEthereum classic fork After people with way too much money lost way too much Ether to a hack they decided centrally to make a rollback which created the fork It would be nice if everyone who was hacked had access to something like that not just the head honchos with the most money Which made me remember of one more centralised system for gold control You can report to the centralised authorities if someone steals your gold instead of incentivising a market where people try to steal it as much as possible I just dont see any reason to think that the crypto market would solve its problems They like their unregulated casino and wont develop good regulations nor accept criticism on their shit products Until that changes pondering how the tech could be useful is pure hopium essentially buying into their propaganda In practice and until proven otherwise crypto coins arent hard nor useful,0,1,0,0,1
 The hardness of gold is partially because it resists manipulation Gold will be gold across civilizations because of natural hardness that Bitcoin also possess because of the Blockchain,1,0,0,1,0

 that was the case a few years ago although utilities that are being tied to the cryptocurrencies people use now are being grounded to a more value based level off of something tangible Obviously it is going to take a long time before cryptos actually become something that is tangibly value based I have to admit that Plus not all cryptos are based on intangible value Stablecoins that are pegged to flat currencies are a great example of this which was a point I see you didnt mention,0,1,0,1,0
 I mean fiat currency is illusory but its a very useful illusion because its a useful abstraction for the purpose of trade And it manages that by being widely adopted stable and having a governing body to regulate it The only strength of currency is the strength we give it and half of the financial industry is madeup nonsense Cryptocurrency lacks utility in part due to lack of mass adoption but even beyond that the processes involved are incredibly inefficient and it is completely lacking in any sort of stability Whats more cryptocurrency is unstable by design because actually the entire point of crypto is to have the value keep going up I know this seems wishywashy and backhanded but no Im not defending crypto and I do think currency is an incredibly useful social construct,0,1,0,0,1
To preface not financial advice I work with cryptos and do more of the technical work People are scared of it because of FUD payed by MSMs usually I try and educate people and let them decider for themselves Thats the key educate We are purposefully uninformed and uneducated to fill a factory slot Centralized banks do not have our money and a decentralized systems actually puts ownership back with the individual Does anyone know that SMS text codes you use to secure your account It can be bypassed by sim swapping Not heard of it? Phone companies have a shit SIM card policy and scammers find out your number Say they lost that phones number and the company sends a SIM card with little to no verification If you do not have a Authenticator application of some sort to send your device a secure code They can take everything from you Everything Crypto is not bad but do not think every project it the one Tokens have genuine use cases and some that solve our Godforsaken old ass fucking settlement systems that have not been updated since ACHs became a thing To end it it sucks that people like cryptos bros well any bro They Fuck up good things in general and banking companies pay literally people to talk shit on stocks to convince people to sell I 200 know that banks also worked in the industry and they are panicking because there are cryptos that runs circles around them Not to mention a decentralized system takes away banking power which in turn Takes away government power I do appreciate calling out bullshit but cryptos is really not one of them,0,1,0,1,1

 Im talking about bitcoin all other coins are questionable btcs system was created with the specific purpose of not having a point of failure and it achieved it up to now since theres no one single party that rules bitcoin or that can controle it If you think there is then good luck finding it out because there isnt any or if you can point to it then let me know but youre probably mistaken And thats why governments from powerful countries fear it and try to delegitimize it because they cant controle it Theres a reason why bitcoin has been growing even though its still hard to use the strongest resistance is from the government not the people which explains the rise in price since its creation the average person find it hard to use it but that is solved with development the same way it happend with the internet Ive never bought bitcoin with fiat so dont worry about me I think you should look into it more you clearly dont know much Youre making the same mistake Mne did conflating bitcoin with some scam coin that some porn star launched yesterday Again just look into it more to find out Andreas Antonopoulos is a good source Saifedean Amous aswell Good luck,0,1,0,1,0
 like I said for that kind of use it will take development but just like the internet in its beginning people do see the value in the technology even though its still hard to use So for now one could say you shouldnt use it to buy groceries but ignoring it completely I dont think its a good idea,0,1,0,1,0
 but people are using it now for all kinds of purposes including regular payments for things its just hard for most people but it is possible The energy costs are pure propaganda it doesnt spend more then the current use of energy to sustain credit card payment systems for example not to mention the fact that mining actually incentivizes finding sustainable sources of energy But in any case responding to the question specifically what we gain is that were not subject to the interests and controle of the powerful anymore they cant controle it if someone could then it would loose its value the whole point of the technology is that security Now people have an option and they arent subject to government favouring special interests by credit creation and money printing for big business and the millitary the people in conrole of the US dont want the endless stream of money printing to end  its completely irresponsible and destructive,1,1,0,0,1
 without money printing to infinity well finally put a break on endless destructive growth on top of that therell be an incentive for people in general but more importantly powerful people being more responsible since they cant print their way out of problems which also limits their capability to controle us like they do now using the state machine people will also need to behave better because theyre gonna depend much more on their communities families friends etc And no the energy cost is not that great as you believe it is were currently spending the same amount of energy on a bunch of other stuff right now and like I said before mining incentivizes and funds finding sustainable energy sources also theres a case study in China where there was vasts amount of energy going to waste in some of their energy generators which then got redirected for mining bitcoin which in turn allowed for investment on improving their methods which meant wasting less energy in its production,1,1,0,1,0

El Salvador has seen issues with adoption of the use of crypto currency because a Its volatile businesses dont want to hold onto assets that can lose money over night b People dont want to take paychecks in bitcoin because you dont want to hold onto assets that can lose money overnight c This volatility creates issues with setting prices as you no longer just have to barter the price of the goods as is typically done you now have to cross refence it with the price of bitcoin which priced in USD making this whole thing completely worthless Its not a currency its a speculative asset This doesnt even touch on the issue d of debt cant really be held in bitcoin creditors are already taking risk with handing out the cash they dont need more risk of possibly losing value of their interest and debtors are just as likely to not want to take loans backed by bitcoin because its value can increase meaning they are getting fucked Christ just reading about the issues El Salvador has faced with Bitcoin implementation basically proves its multimillions dollar investment in it could have funded schools which actually produce value Not only that payments are slow as bitcoin is consistently slow because its transaction limit is fucking awful Also to prove my point about holding value which a currency is meant to do as its a unit of exchange that doesnt change all that much BTC has lost 8 in the last week Businesses and people have bills to pay I cant risk my revenue evaporating like that El Salvadors use case basically shows the exact problems of this supposed currency it needs wide spread adoption to bring down its volatility but its volatility helped produce its widespread adoption as you yourself acknowledge it was a financial incentive 90 of BTC and crypto users dont use it to exchange goods and services they use it because number go up Currencies arent investments they arent suppose to be things which you hold onto,0,1,1,0,1

 Your wish is my command All of my friends stuff starts after the line break as an attorney who frequently handles real estate matters let me be the first to say NFTs do not and can not confer real estate ownership you could theoretically set up a corporation that could do something that makes it look like NFTs confer real estate ownership but itd be about as secure as swiss cheese real estate transfers are all registered by the states you cant transfer title in a way anyone is bound to respect without recording the transfer with your local government office so NFT transfers lolno so the way you get around these I cant do X transaction without registering it with the state issues is to set up a corporation the corporation owns the real estate in question Ownership of shares of a corporation are NOT registered with the state every time they change hands so you can realistically confer ownership this way but three problems arise one you need an ironclad way to write into the corporations charter than the NFT transfers also denote transfers of shares of the corporation you can probably do this! butbut why would you bother? shares of a corporation are already things you can buy and sell in private transactions they dont need to be NFTs because they already have that allimportant attribute of free transferability Making it an NFT makes it harder to transfer because realistically you can only do it on NFT exchanges so there can be no private transactions this is actually more restrictive than you need to be! two corporations need a human being to manage them its a legal requirement you cant not have one and that manager would be in charge of among other things verifying the ownership of the members whenever they try to take an action and would have a fiduciary duty to them in other words its someone you need to compensate no ones taking on that liability for a collection of freely transferrable NFTs for free so ok you own real estate via NFT but you have to pay an extra overhead fee for the privilege of owning real estate in a really dumb way three generally when you own real estate you mean you own a parcel free and clear so you can do what you want with it if you own via corporation that isnt true you just get a vote equal to your membership interest as to what to do with it allx000D x000D Also state coop laws probably forbid having a corporation that parcels out individual pieces of real estate so I mean yes you could set this all up as a coop and do that but uh that gets you back to the question of what the NFT piece gets you and basically it gets you nothing except an extra avenue of attack in litigation,0,1,0,0,1

 It does exist as far as I knowunderstand The pools that shes mentioned in this video They arent a single entity theyre comprised of both people with a huge pile of hardware and people like lets say you and me with a single GPU casually mining I dont mine its just an example to describe the thing So in one of those pools theres like 10000 people who are all a part of the pool in order to greatly increase the chance of getting a block rewardeg Bitcoin each round When youre mining by yourself youve got a 1 in thenumberofnodesinthenetwork chance to get the block reward BTC Thats miniscule In a pool your chance to get BTC is thenumberofnodesinthepool in thenumberofnodesinthenetwork but that reward is fairly distributed in between all of the modes making uo the pool youre in Thats notnprecisely how it works but it paints the picture accurately enough Thats the biggest reason for pools existing And umm the concentration of coins on a perindividualbasis that shes presented in this video is worrying but I think that it is wrong because Ive been payong attentio to crypti for about a year now and no where have I seen sucha disturbing piece of info that eg 30 of BTC is held by a few people But yeah not sure about this I merely think its inaccurate,0,1,0,1,0

 The value of gold is already predetermined by its market use in history You could say that its just like fiat but there are some key differences The most important one is that you cant produce gold out of thin air and its pretty scarce If you gather all of the worlds gold you will fill only two swimming pools Then it has a material value because its used in various materials like prothetic teeth for example Of course if there was overproduction it can get inflated and fall in value The Spanish Empire for example fell because of gold inflation because they brought too much gold into the Spanish market from the colonies In Egypt when Mansa Munsa passed by they got some serious inflation problem However worldwide you cant have inflation of gold unlike we have inflation of dollar now,0,1,0,1,0

the actual market is based on the real labor intensive production of commodities for sale so currencies involved actually represent both actual value the commodities and in turn the labor used in creating those commodities this system is inherently unstable for a variety of reasons but the NFT market is a completely superfluous addition to an already fucked market mainly because there is no actual production of value involved unless you call hooking your pc up to a botnet production its basically a stock market on top of a stock market and is thus built on a house of cards of meaningless tokens which constantly serve as ponzi schemes and fluctuate in value constantly,0,1,1,0,1

 You couldnt even begin to pay for the infrastructure that powers you home This what the private market does everyday this is entirely a false statement infrastructure can be maintained without government intervention and standardization is actually antithetical to government it doesnt standardize anything it always relies on contractors who it claims knows the field if it does though often times theyre trash because they dont actually give contracts to competing businesses but ones that are often highly associated with the bureaucrats and politicians which often dont compete because theyre government owned as well However those businesses dont produce anything of value anyway Also this is a false paradigm its a false dichotomy just because a regular individual may not be able to pay for something does not exclude them from the manners of being capable to pay indirectly whether it be crowdfunding or crowdsourcing or by offloading it onto businesses who are more capable to pay or manage the payment or some other case which you dont know Regardless this is not an valid argument it is also unsound that powers you home and allows you to travel conveniently to the various places you need to go to live your life Actually roads used to be paid and managed by private entities and there are many roads and even some highways that are still maintained by private entities not government ones as for power its government that makes it so expensive not the money the only reason infrastructure is made so expensive is because only a limited amount of people are allowed access to perform infrastructure projects its a land monopoly caused by government even in the case with something like Nuclear Power being so expensive upfront there is nothing that requires it to be a monopoly just because its expensive there is no logical reason individuals couldnt form competing businesses if not for government intervention and regulation inherently preventing that Much of that has long been regulated and managed by government claiming its better but the problem with that claim is especially that nobody actually bothered to enable a privatized market in the first place so any claim regarding the private market is inherently false You cant make a claim like this when you have no justification to point to regarding that claim it is inherently baseless The government and the various things that finance your life are so much more fundamental Actually not for the market our modern concept of government intervention is a late 1800s invention before that private entities in part at least managed and maintained everything youre claiming the government did They were true contractors contracted by the government now some of these so claimed contractors were in fact government entities claiming not to be Hudson Bay Company East India Company ect but those fact companies still hired out contracts for which they did not heavily regulate the contractors beyond seeking a desired job finished However people were impatient for competition and didnt care to actually invest in private local enterprises to compete so they voted for government to arbitrarily fix the problem who was already regulating who would get benefits and even to an extent usable land resulting in the development of corporate entities that became even bigger and were regulated by the government Fundamentally these corporate entities were even more powerful as they would have an in with the government so long as they played the game which most of the time they did This was development of modern corporate lobbyism These corporations got advantages and functionally cornered the market under duopolies provided by their advantages and government lobbyism Majority of this happened exclusively in the late 19th century Before this there were no established corporations that werent made provided for or subsidized by a government than any sense of freedom you have Also the government doesnt exist to provided or equalize the playing field thats not its role their only purpose is to enact vengeance in a righteous manner This means government is punitive not preventative for one can not enact vengeance preventative it also means it cant justly entering business You are subsidized to the hilt by other people whether you like them or not This is a false argument its completely unrelated and irrelevant its also not actually true so long as you are laboring and competing for a job Thats most people The market does not subsidize as each individual who competes and labors in the market is paid in accordance to their demand in the market so to claim that those in the market are subsidized is false Maybe government employees but even thats not entirely true All a subsidy does it unbalance the market against its own fair equity it does not overthrow it Its absolutely annoying that so many prolibertarian arguments are idealistic ideas Idealism would suggest wed live in a utopia to do so thats not the libertarian argument and to say it would be idealistic or is considered idealistic is an outright strawman No the argument is it would be better but it does not solve poverty it does not solve homelessness it does not solve drug use it does not solve social issues Those who push for government want the government to solve these things for the sake of a utopia stealing from others because we must have a bleeding heart instead of volunteering their own time and effort to the problem for a libertarian money doesnt make the world go round a libertarian just wants to be left alone regardless of whether it be better for they believe each individual knows better for themselves than any government could which is the foundation of the American Constitution of freedom Freedom is not idealistic it doesnt expect wide solutions it desires personal responsibility Individuals will decide by themselves whether they live or die whether theyre rich or poor whether theyre happy or depressed it is not up to the government to solve You cant be free if you try to outsource this to the government and childish takes of taxes 99 of taxes of the modern era did not exist 100 years ago Taxation as it stands now did not build the infrastructure and government without seeing just how much those very things made the people who are giving said uninformed and unanalyzed opinions lives possible Actually you cant claim this there is absolutely no basis to this claim at all and was entirely made up you have to be able to prove such a claim as true or false a nonfalsifiable claim can not in essence be granted a claim of truth by basic rationality It is not allowed to be an argumentative claim then What we do have are examples of advancement of previous generations for which that was untrue that demonstrates it probably isnt a true claim but again probably false and being provably false are not the same thing However there is nothing substantiated nor rational for which this could either be true and youve shown nothing of proof to even introspect truth let alone demonstrate truth from such a claim Thus your argument is invalid,0,1,1,1,0
 There has been a lot of research and books written how the concept of a mob was formed and how it was a narrative mostly put forth by the powerful few The homogenous mob is a weird thing to take at face value because everyone has different rationale and thought processes There is no freedom when youre controlled by private interest like I dont agree with you about fools voting for paying themselves to the ground because there are literally autonomous coops that run democratically and have been running for decades but even if what you said is true I believe that people should have a right to run themselves to the ground instead of someone else maybe preventingand possibly failing to prevent them from doing so,0,0,0,1,0

 its not about scarcity Like I said NFTs dont have to be unique Its a means to digital ownership Currently you dont own your digital data and im not speaking of your profile picture or blog posts on social media In those cases digital ownership obviously combats censorship But if you purchase something like a movie on youtube or a game on steam the company that hosts the webstore actually has total control over what YOU payed for This is just an example but if you where to buy a copy of a movie or game as an NFT much like a government law book the blockchain agrees that you own it and by extension that whoever sold it to you cannot just take it away anymore You will own nothing and you will be happy Its a quote that is often associated with a potential state of society that the control and power large corporations enabled by capitalism will lead to Blockchain and crypto are concepts that are inherently against this Its a technology that facilitates true ownership within the digital space which distopic as it may be is where a lot of people spend more time than in the real world TLDR its not about scarcity its about ownership and control of the induvidual,1,1,0,0,1

Anonymity was never cryptos main purpose First of all different crypto have different use cases eg Ethereum was meant to allow people to make predefined agreements that would not have to be verified and enforced by a third party it does that pretty well Bitcoin was meant to be a currency that would not be beholdent to governmentscentral banks printing money which it does pretty well NFTs were meant to sell people useless and intrinsically worthless numbers on a blockchain again it does it pretty well I dont see the problem here it all works as intended,0,0,0,1,0
 I dont follow what your argument is Blockchain technology and web3 will benefit you and I greatly this isnt some extension from capitalist overlords to keep you down You will have stronger guarantees from the institutions you work with such as your bank insurance companies employer landlord etc that your agreements can not be changed at a whim You will have guarantees that our financial institutions are not practicing extreme fraudulent activity leading to financial crashes like 2008 You will have guarantees that your trusted stock exchange will not close access to trading at the most critical moment for example Robinhood halting trading when GameStops stock price exploded If you are of an open mind I recommend you to take some time and listen to the first 28 minutes of this talk to hear the argument of why you should care about blockchain ,1,0,0,1,0
There is actually Something i can do with my virtual gold Like buy a Portion or a Upgrade material,1,0,0,1,0
Yea and when you sell gold and in some cases accounts with valuable petsmountstransmogs etc youre actually selling a product to someone that they will use A character they can play as and skip time sinks that would be required to farm the gold The Play to Earn IS the time sink and you barely make any money just clicking a button in order to make the people above you more rich,0,1,0,0,1
NFT games are pretty much bad MMORPGs developed to embrace real money trading RMT the more general form of gold farming That said I feel very hesitant to use the term game because the platforms in my opinion are just terrible deadend jobs Your work for an NFT holder where the job is repetitive grinding inspired by gameplay elements Id be even bold enough to say the game is a ruse to make the rich NFT overlord think they are providing entertainment for the peasants under them,0,1,1,0,0
The difference is you hold custody over that asset and can sell it without getting ripped off Thats where NFT comes in otherwise theres no difference Imagine instead of losing all those microtransactions you got all your gear as a token you could sell,1,0,0,1,0

When I step back and try to look at the whole picture I think of how MMOs with ingame auction houses have rampant hyperinflation problems because killing monsters really does generate infinite gold Part of the reason why World of Warcraft has managed to last for 20 years is because Blizzard started hiring economists to keep the economy in WoW from crashing Ive looked from time to time but Ive never seen any former video game economists whove studied gold and item farming weigh in on the whole situation with cryptocurrency and NFTs I can only assume there are airtight nondisclosure agreements in place,0,1,0,0,1

 no bro has nothing to do with being proagainst cryptocurrencies the video is titled Web30  but the video just outlines some very generic basic and non inherent problems in cryptocurrencies PoW electricity consumption scams deployed on various network as if the HTTP email and even basic TCPIP protocols havent been used by scammers lmao and such problems which are recognized by the crypto community and are addressed like Ethereum moving to PoS and more and more projects focusing on PoS Also her understanding of the concept of P2P networks and verification math is just something else We need a way to verify integrity of information without relying on a centralized authority literally everybody wants that and cryptochain like technologies have been used internally by banks for decades already to verify all internal routing,0,1,0,1,0

 Again black and white thinking How about you start to quantify things? Its easy to say all of crypto takes the energy of a small country but just look at the energy cost of the global banking system for a second Even if it would be the same automating the process and safing lots of manpower and actually greedy middle man would be a huge advancement,0,1,0,1,0
 Well what if we quantify the amount of energy consumption up to the amount of the traditional banking system? Or down to the amount of cryptousers? Id argue SWIFT requires less computing power and therefore energy consumption than cryptocurrencies especially because it doesnt require mining which is basically solving extremely complex mathematical problems hence crypto 70 of the world population uses the banking system Not scaling it down to the same amount of cryptousers would be disingenuous,0,1,0,0,1
 It only requires 10 banksATMs at every corner that need to be maintained and a huge amount of people to drive there every day but lets ignore that ig U also cant just group all crypto into the financial system cause it has a lot more use cases than this Again energy source matters too And crypto has the potential to be 100 renewable energy that otherwise couldnt have been accessed And its still in its infancy Most future orientiert projects wont even be required to mine they run on proof of stake Proof of history is also a thing Massive potential to automate and comodify many things in the world and make them more efficient faster securer and transparent Why do u think all the banks working on their own crypto rn? They just suck at it and cant compete with the other big ones,1,1,0,1,0

Given the technological advantages of Blockchain tech could provide a extreme leg up for marginalised communities with building decentralised renewable power grids that allow rural indigenous communities to profit off their energy generation while essentially setting this up with enough power for life Yeah thats the thing shes not interested she just says everything sucks because negativity gets lots of social engagement on youtube,1,1,1,0,0
 Tbh majority of these ideas have been tried and tested to no avail navigating traditional financial routes of funding indigenous related projects have a track record of being tokenistic gestures from governments over actually pushing them for acceptable outcomes Maybe building on the blockchain may provide social economic and educational opportunities for these communities that want to take it on board opposed to trying to game the current system which is clearly not helping them,0,1,0,0,1
USER I havent heard of anything like this being done before seems too new for it to have precedence The way I envision it you would have tokens that generate per the energy created via renewables solar and those tokens can then be used to buyswapsell electricity My understanding of decentralisation looks at who can turn it off and on at a whim Depending on the network the project rolls out on it could be possible to actually provide all the network infrastructure and let the communities decide how they would like to utilise it At that point a few middle men who control the max supply of BTCETH cant really do shit about the use value of commodifying energy transfer between micro grids IMO,0,1,0,1,0
 Unfortunately between the bureaucracy of local state and federal governance and their lacklustre supports grants including their remoteness to majority of traditional private enterprise are usually the last to contribute to a long term sustainabilityfocused project In our circumstances here it makes all the more sense to legitimise their communities and expectations through developing systems that benefit them first Not peddling some tokenistic gesture of corporate or governance investment portfolio,0,0,1,0,1
USER anyone with about 40 in their pocket can fork etherium Massive hacks typically occur when using exchanges The on and off ramps of crypto currency where crypto is exchanged for fiat through middle men are where people lose their money Rug pull scams on dodgy exchanges are also very common Currently where you live is rng Youre either lucky enough to be born in a good country or youre not There is simply no meaningful way to take wealth out of a country like China You are trapped With crypto however you can cross the border naked and take your money with you This puts pressure on governments to provide services like roads Healthcare human rights etc to convince you to continue using their currency because for the first time in history you can opt out People trade everything like stocks btw its no different than the forex market for currencies or the futures market for wheat and oil People gamble on the weather if you let them,0,1,0,0,1
USER Elons market manipulation for funsies was pretty disgusting Bitcoin fails completely as a currency It makes much more sense when evaluated as a digital substitute for physical gold It is universally recognized fungible immutable and stores value against inflation Its not super exciting but it shouldnt be It does everything a brick of gold would do but you dont have to use middle men to secure physical custody of it or get armored trucks to move it Layer 2 crypto currencies like etherium cardano avalanch and polkadot are interesting because they arent just speculative gold substitutes Their programmability through smart contracts makes them productive assets like companies Things like cardano that have minimal transaction fees minute energy usage and complex smart contract infrastructure for facilitating trust less loans are the ones that could become currency Its not a winner takes all situation though Taco bell still exists at the same time as McDonalds Nfts will be the dot com bubble of the crypto age They are basically petscom,0,1,0,0,1

1what stops a singular authority such as a government or corporation from acquiring the majority of a giben coin stock and dictating terms? 2 The overwhelming point however that the rich have direct means to blatantly manipulate the market in their own interests at any point That said you bring up an interesting point If Satoshi is dead that means his money died with him In an ecosystem with finite tokens to funge doesnt that put a hard timer on your carnival tokens having any viability for any form of transaction? 3You sir need to just accept the L and move on Your tokens waste electricity and dont even bring enjoyment or entertainment beyond these documentaries that mercilessly dissect your worthless greater fool scheme,0,1,1,0,1
 USER Britton 1 Bitcoin changes are not determined by who owns the most coins its determined by each individual mining machine casting a vote In theory a crazy rich cartel could buy up a shitton of miners and sway the vote but this is effectively impossible due to game theory and finance issues see what happened with Bitcoin cash and BSV for an example of exactly this Ironically if someone were to buy a bunch of mining machines with nefarious intentions they are at the same time only making Bitcoin even stronger by adding that much more hashing power The most likely outcome if a state sanctioned power with unlimited money wanted to do this is it would cause a fork just like BCH and BSV that splits off and eventually dies because again Why would you want to debase your own investment? This is game theory 101 I dont understand what youre trying to say about satoshis coins being dormant how does that put any timer on anything? I dont think you understand how mining works but Id be happy to explain if you can clarify The only thing Satoshi coins being dormant does is make coins in circulation even more rare thus more valuable As for your last point you can disagree of bitcoins merits I dont care But just because you dont find value in it doesnt mean others dont Should I tell the whole esports industry to take the L because I find running around shooting each other in virtual worlds to be meaningless and a waste of electricity? Christmas lights each season across the globe use more electricity than Bitcoin mining does in a year should we outlaw that? Are you aware how much electricity for our current fiat system uses? Do a Google search just on upkeep of US coins costs or even just ATMs There is literally nothing like Bitcoin in terms of a scarce resource that can be transferred from person to person without any auditor ever in human history Gold is a close contender but it is not completely fungible like BTC and who knows how much gold we may eventually find in outer space,0,1,0,1,0

And thanks for noting to me you lack the skills to think critically and only things that you find value in hold any meaning Youre moving goalposts now first you conflated coin supply holdings with wielding power to change code now youre trying to argue someone holding a large portion of a deflationary ecosystem holds any type of power which is asinine and shows your ignorance in basic econ And whoever said a majority of the BTC ecosystem had lost their coins WTF you talking about? And who said I was ever mad at or fighting with the banks? In my OP I literally said I dont think Bitcoin will replace fiat that doesnt mean it has no use case still,0,1,1,0,1

Hey Sean Video games might use a lot of electricity but in return we get strap in for this one video games Like that we can play! Or watch others play! Isnt it amazing how all that power gives us something of value in return?,1,0,0,1,0
 it was one of many examples Obviously there are plenty of people who find value in mining or using Bitcoin as well My main point when it comes to energy use is the main problem is how a majority of our energy infrastructure replies on fossil fuels Additionally Bitcoin mining game theory incentivizes miners to invest in renewables If BTC were ever to become mainstream 99 of transactions would be later 2 which dramatically decrease energy consumption And this is completely ignoring the idea of proof of stake The whole energy consumption argument is just a bad one,0,1,0,1,0
 See if they invest in renewables it doesnt lower the energu consumption it offsets it since the electricity waste is the point of the coins value,0,1,0,0,1

 Why would they share all of their profits to the workers there? did the workers invest capital and take on the finciacal liability of those profits or are they working on contracted schedule? but nonetheless since crypto is minted via a third party that is a protocol that cant be altered without the wide financial consesent of the users rich people can be loaned money for essentially free from the government that this side loves so much to accumulate capital they actually have to buy a limited supply of assets which means the price goes up for all holders which if you get paid in lets say ethereum your wealth grows by the accumulation of capital of the wealthy oh yeah you could also be the one providing liquidity for decentralized exchanges and earn profit from these trades and earn interest but yea fuck crypto cause capitalism bad,0,1,0,0,1
 they can easily fork Bitcoin again and have it go two separate ways its happened in the past and can happen again and until theres actually a substantial increase in transaction times hardly anyone is going to adopt crypto as a replacement for fiat currency there isnt enough minted or planned to be minted to make it an actual viable currency So at one point theyll have to fork to start creating more BTC beyond the current cap and that doesnt need the permission of wider financial institutions at all thats what decentralization means it doesnt mean that they have to get everyones approval it means whoever controls the code can implement any forks to the procedure to modify the trajectory and allow for more BTC and thus Satoshis to be broken down from that to actually be usable as a pseudofiat currency right now its literally just a dying form of tax evasion and a really bad investment because it hinges so much on popular opinion about it its not tied to any standard at all so its extremely volatile compared to currency currently in use Butt yeah to complete idiots more crypto is good but explain how? You literally stated that they arent going to share their profits so who does this help anyone other than the people who thought well gee now that China doesnt want us fucking up their whole scene with crypto ops back to the US theyre not doing this to help the US economy theyre doing it because the US is the only place thatll really allow them to set up these operations at this scale If Bitcoin is the future according to you since cryptogood capitalismgood future how is it supposed to help by just accruing more wealth for the same people that already have a vast majority of it?

 Whats your point tho who doesnt hate EA? When I say triple AAA I mean a company with enough access to developers ect And funding this is incredibly rare in the blockchain space thus AAA studios will most likely create the multiplayer games I would love to play and thus be adopted Just my 2 cents tho If you think 2 ppl can create a functioning sandbox like inviroment in a entirely new programing language you are out of your mind,0,1,1,0,0

 I think it could be important in having a complete view of nfts to consider the potential vs the current use NFTs can unlock a lot of potential such as digital identity which could be very scary in some iterations but also very awesome in others For example what if nfts can represent ones identity digitally and thus you could have one account that represents you is immutable and you hold the full control over It could have public and private elements as needed for individual privacy concerns A change of address could be implemented across all necessary platforms in a few clicks Self verification processes could be expedited Voting could be made both more secure and less prone to manipulation Most DAOs will be replaced with proofofhumanity NFTs to ensure both that actors are real people who hold one account and that wealth is not a factor in governance All of this could be done without NFTs but the a big part of Blockchain techs importance is making existing systems defacto more efficient which there is a lot of work to be done in that regard still but it is being done much like how every single piece of modern infrastructure once used exponentially more energy per use Also arguments comparing the energy use of crypto vs energy use of traditional eaters of energy are often flawed because they do not consider what the variables are in the equation for energy consumption in either model or what that equation might look like Basically cryptocurrency uses energy most directly proportional to the amount of people competing for the newly created value of the network as transactions are processed but not so much in the transaction count and absolutely none from the value of transactions Legacy means of transfer the main variable that weights the equation is the number and size of transactions and the system requires a lot of bureaucracy to keep up Essentially crypto will use more energy then traditional mediums of transfer as long as there is economic incentive to put more power into the system but not necessarily by increased adoption and use of the network Network adoption could obviously drive up mining competition but you also have to consider if the premium of BTC against the cost of production of BTC is a result of the scarcity and the currently relatively small groups of both utilizers and miners more miners means more people to undercut eachother The premium will disappear with widespread adoption and the economic incentive will normalize and it most likely would use much less energy then legacy finance in this unlikely scenario of mass BTC adoption That said I view btc as most likely being Archie or Gopher and we may still be waiting for Yahoo or at least to discover who will be Yahoo and who will be Google in this space,1,0,0,1,1
Your carbon neutral ways might be fine for smartcontract platforms but PoS is absolutely not suited for monetary crypto Last thing I want is rich people getting richer from staking without any involvement in the project and just getting stake until the end of time because once your money is staked its locked in there and requires 0 effort to make money with it For bitcoin proof of work is superior I understand PoS for smartcontract or DeFi platforms,0,1,0,0,1

 so blockchains are extremely useful because theyre effectively unhackable when used with trusted nodes meaning not decentralized a company can have absolute certainty of the contents of the database that means any transactions andor modifications made have a complete historical record This is particularly useful for things like recordkeeping property management and tracking IBM has been selling their blockchain solution business to business for several years now also yes the spamvertisements are extremely annoying but i had posted the comments and confirmed they were visible for a while on other accounts since youtube automatically censors a lot of comments based on the channels settings for example most channels wont let you link to outside sites so i need to provide my citations by title and author rather than a direct link to the articles They were also posted within a few hours of the video going up which almost always results in replies,1,0,0,1,0
 But that doesnt really make it unhackable in the practical sense Man in the middle attacks are so rare as to be a minor issue at best Your real problem will be people putting false or faulty information into your chain Also how do we correct more common oopsies?

 It does make it unhackable You would need at a minimum 13 of all the trusted nodes to be under the control over a bad actor Your real problem will be people putting false or faulty information into your chainx000D which is impossible for the average attacker Im not sure why you brought up MITM attacks specifically I guess the idea of getting rid of the middle man confused you? That part is just removing an unwanted third party With blockchain transactions become trustless meaning the network itself verifies the transaction instead of some neutral arbitrator like a bank or lawyer Also how do we correct more common oopsies? oopsies dont happen Since the current implementations are all internal if somehow data needs to be changed then its changed via the normal routes For example if youre tracking tracking a package for proof of providence purposes all that information is usually scanned in and verified on the spot If a user sees that scanning a package in florida is somehoow saying its been scanned in toronto they can try and scan it again or call it in but if youre getting crazy problems like that in production something seriously went wrong with your QA and devops,0,1,0,1,0

 Sorry for confusing you but I provided two separate examples One was for specific use within a company which is the centralized method but the other was the network effect for a public cryptocurrency There is the issue of premining but usually no one is brazen enough to premine 33 of the carrying capacity of the chain this would obviously be pretty scammy To more fully answer your question in a youtube comment the answer is that it would be prohibitively expensive at this point for anyone to do that For a PoW chain theyd need to control a full 51 of the hashing power of the network For a PoS network theyd need to own 334 of the tokens to break even It would be pretty obvious that someone was doing this though as youd see overt conflicts arising Im sure with all these garbage coins out there its probably happened at some point but at that point most people would immediately start bailing Basically the public currencies are too distributed for any individual to attack and and it would take a few nations to invest a preposterous amount of resources just to slightly disrupt the network In the case of PoS they would likely lose a large portion of their investment as well as with only 334 theyd lose 50 of the stakes each time so theyd need to continuously acquire more tokens somehow all the while risking devaluing the chain and losing their investment Honestly you could just read the BTC whitepaper Its not that long and theres not that much jargon in it The only people whove made a video and actually read the thing seem to me be Joe Scott and Folding Ideas guy though the latter doesnt even cite it and ignores most of what it says since the focus was on the art market rather than crypto at large for his video I dont think any one of them has read any of the ethereum papers,0,1,0,1,0

 NFT crypto is definitely a scam I never said it wasnt but the idea of bitcoin was to create a kind of thing that would prevent bad use of debt The reason countries stuck to a gold standard for millennium was because governments had the habit of borrowing too much debt or printing too much money so they tied it to gold Bitcoin is a new type of gold because you cant print more of it There is a fixed supply The role of gold and bitcoin is to prevent over borrowing and over printing of money by sovereigns because those scenarios inevitably screw over the populace with inflationhyperinflation It is not a replacement for debt,0,1,0,0,1

Is it wrong for the gov to be able to peak into the livesbehaviors of citizen under the excuse of they are criminals and Im just doing that to stop terrorist plots? x000D Palantir software undeniably stops deranged incel maniacs before they act for example but at the cost of the gov peeking into the lives of its citizen x000D But that begs the question should that type of processing software be banned because one actorclient uses it that way if other clients use the software to better distribute vaccines? In most commercial cases Foundry is used to process supply chain data flight data car data etc Simple as that Palantir doesnt build software that will for example go throught the Internet to spot key words linked to acts of violence The gov already has that But that kind of software would simply aggregate the nodes into a data base without actually linking those specific data points with others IP address actual address name of people living at that address etc Thats where the software sold by Palantir will come in It will take those nodes of data to create the network of behavior that the CIA then uses Like Karp points out in the interview that knowledge of the network is highly powerful It is the same kind of network that Meta Facebook or Google have on you when you use their services and sign your rights to privacy away They sell that network of behavior to advertisers But network of behavior can be created for things like a supply chain Its not because some companies use it for individuals that it is restricted to that use,0,1,0,1,1

 well I am a capitalist I live off my investments in crypto that I was able to fund initially by working 40 hours a week in a pizza shop and literally only splurging on a bottle of bbq sauce once a month saving as much as I could This was at the start of defi so its not like Im a magic investors but just got in lucky and with dedication I was a worker did I find my job exploitation? Actually yea but by people who were getting paid just as much as me but working at 12 of the efficiency You just dont want to work or have to compete so you want to forcefully rip apart society assuming youd have the luxury to be apart of the group that chooses who works where people have tried socialism this argument dosent work anymore socialism has failed every single time and has killed 67 million people in the past 100 years Competition breeds competent people through a natural process in position in the hierarchy where if they arent competent society while fall apart Thats one of the biggest issues with monarchism fascism and socialism Not every sports player is equal not every surgeon is equal not every scientist is equal and expecting to somehow turn off hierarchies which exists in every social species and even between species is insane,0,1,1,0,0
 It is actually helping the renewable industry by providing them profit As it doesnt provide any more profit than any other activity its actually just using energy that is needed elsewhere and thereby increasing the need for other nonrenewable sources as demand cant keep up! Also were seeing a lot of examples where cryptominers hatch themselves to the powergrid illegally similar to how drug production facilities is known to do it Also as I mentioned in an earlier comment a lot of the developing countries where MY tax money helps build renewalble energy sources meant to provide cheap electricity to the local population has suddenly seen cryptominers set up shop there so Im basically helping funding leeches profiting on something that is intended to help develope the countries run their hospitals their schools while avoid harming the environment as much as possible!

 Bitcoin transaction uses as much energy as sending email does The big numbers you see for energy usage is the energy used by miners to secure the network against a 51 attack Ethereum uses less but thing is ethereum is 1 not a store of value its a decentralized computer you only buy the tokens when you need to buy computing power and 2Proof of Stake which is just fiat system with extra steps where rich get richer and have more control over the system The only reason Bitcoin was created was to fight this type of thing we use word DECENTRALIZED for a reason,0,1,0,0,1

 If I understand you correctly you mean something along the lines of a blockchain version of a server handshake? Something not tied to any form of currency or personal data transfer but just an alternative way of checking player input by distributing the checks across everyone in the game rather than just at the serverhost connection? If thats what youre saying I can see it maybe working but I feel like it could have too much latency to be functional for most things and might just unnecessarily increase the amount of pings you have to make It could be an interesting thing to explore from that perspective but it would have to always remain divorced from real money and personal data,0,1,0,1,0
 pretty much Client side processing and voting isnt foreign in these scenarios though And if youre not using it to vote on did that bullet hit but is this harvested resource valid the latency isnt as much as an issue Also client side processing and voting is already a way to reduce latency Now also think youre only considering a maximum of 16 32 or 64 concurrent users on any given node Having thousands of users in a world but only a dozen or so directly interacting on one node with rare cross node communication isnt that unusual Even in massive worlds,0,0,0,1,0

 same incentive anyone fires up a game client They get to play the game Lots of games already decentralise and offload processing to clients and the vast majority of players dont have a clue or care,0,0,0,1,0
 That would require both devs and players to see the currency unit as means of exchange for other stuff and be willing to see value in the game and its stuff for lack of a more general word Thing is most crypto projects start the other way round from the currencyNFT and try to conjure a game to use it The whole incentive structure thus ends up being impossibly broken This is ignoring the absurdly high processing costs of the block validation mechanisms which mostly only reach a reasonable equilibrium when the token is somewhat unpopular For me the best existing market for crypto and NFTs is expensive fine art places where the token can in no way be confused for the real object and where the transparency provided by blockchain is an undeniable asset Imagine if every million dollar painting that was auctioned had to be bought and sold on a publicly available blockchain Imagine if every museum had to have an NFT showing the origin and movement of every artwork donated to them It would be great for halting tax evasion Admittedly theres probably a million problems with this plan I havent thought of feel free to rip it to shreds,0,1,0,0,1
 what currency? Theres no currency mentioned in fact I explicitly excluded currency The absurbedly high cost is not a necessity of blockchain per se its an artificial limit imposed on them to try and in some cases successfully manufacture value for the cryptocurrencies that use them I am not proposing another currency I am proposing an alternative use for blockchains private to a particular game server instance that deal with maybe a couple of hundred people tops in the background transparent to users that is purely used for accounting for resources on that server and making hacks harder to hide Edit Im just saying this because I think it may make where Im coming from easier to see I am vehemently and ethically opposed to microtransactions in game currencies with any link to real money or in game items being traded in or outside of the game for real money,0,1,0,0,1
 Apologies I should have been clearer I meant currency not as an equivalent to more conventional currency but as the token of transaction in the game I completely get and support your point there what I was trying to say is that generally people start with a token with realworld value and attempt to build a product around it instead of starting with a game and ending up with blockchain tokens as a means of exchange The incentives are broken,0,1,0,0,1
 no worries and Im sorry if I sounded rude But the incentive is purely being able to play the game This isnt meant to be a way to mine in game currency purely for accounting did this player legitimately pick up this resource So the algorithm can be made efficient instead of purposely inefficient Your vote on if an entry is valid is purely 1 vote per client and not based on how wealthy a client is I do not see this working for something like CoD in that case all that overhead should be swallowed by Activision and any usage of blockchains would be cynical at best More something like Minecraft where people spin up their own servers often out of the goodness of their hearts with no financial incentive,0,1,1,1,0

 Your concept has merit and Ive thought of using it the same way People need to research what makes a blockchain and what the applications of that technology would be It would become blatantly obvious that cryptocurrrency is a misuse of it Its true use and strength is its ability to create a strong encryption rapidly without the need of a preexisting solution The simple example for a game would be a server where network hacking might be a risk like in an MMO Depending on how strong you want the protection to be A new short blockchain can be generated for the encryption at the start of the current sign in This encryption would likely be very light on performance because only the two devices know the solution and it would still take a substantial amount of time to break plus the data isnt that important This can be expanded to larger groups of devices as well using a token style transmission The main benefit of the blockchain is that the key for the encryption becomes increasingly randomizedstronger by having more devices involved when compared to it being generated by just one You can stop expanding it for reuse at any time Unlike the cryptocurrency application Is this a necessary thing to do for games No not really but at least wed be using the technology for what it was meant do do Rather than the endlessly bloating database it is now,1,0,0,1,0

 now as far as useful use cases of its current predicted form go Its just a way to run a database Having the address book that is the internet backed up over as many places as there are nodes and having those nodes synchronize in the way the technology provides Just means it is more secured against tampering which it currently can be weak to Privately it can make sure records are more tamper proof too A government run network that used it could record every change made to a piece of land have that record be more reliable Since you can only add changes if someone accidentally tries to make some malignant changes there will forever be a record A central database that tracks stuff like this probably already exists All web30 needs to do to actually fully be successful is make that database work better The power cost isnt even inherent since the draw is based on each chains size,0,1,0,1,0

As we speak there are countless mining operations either already operating or in the process of going online that are effectively stopping methane which has a 70X greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide from being pumped into the earths atmosphere Keep in mind that to this point in time these methane leaks were being allowed to freely expel all their methane content into the air contributing a lot to the greenhouse effect thats causing our issues Thousands more of the big operations are mining through hydroelectric sources dams or the use of solar electricity And more of them will go green as its becoming cheaper in more areas of the globe to go the green energy route over the dirty energy Its actually kind of a miracle how the two incentives mining BTC for the highest possible profit and having a net positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions are actually starting to align with one another!,1,0,0,1,0
 But youre leaving the most beautiful part out in your analogy The mother earth has aligned incentives in such a way that humans can both maximize profits mining bitcoin cheaply AND have a net positive effect on greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere For the first time ever in human history were incentivized financially to go green as the closest things to free energy available that allows for the highest mining profits are either green energy sources hydro electric dams or even better suck greenhouse gases out of the air mining from volcanic methane leaks and the like!

Spotify Just for example or any other music streaming service may be giving the money to the songs singerowner based on its own company rules maybe based on how many times the song is played or in which regions of world it is played more or if the listener is a Spotify premium user or not there can be any rule that Spotify may wish to ask the song owners to agree to But if instead the same service is on a blockchain then the user can directly transfer desirably a small amount to the song owner here we will directly have access to the song owners blockchain account This is more understandable if I put myself in place of sellers music creator art creator etc I would definitely want that whatever I want to sell to my customer no middleman should be there no take away parts of my profit But the same doubt I too have that the present models are also successful eg present music streaming apps freelancing work website,1,1,0,1,0

Because you want to support the artist you like As he said when you listen to YT Spotify etc The artist gets paid through the ads displayed before the video But first YouTube takes some of that ad money then the label then the artist so by buying the token the artist gets paid with less intermediarys And you still didnt go into the red because you theoretically paid with your own data that you also own Normally your own data would be owned by GoogleYouTube and before loading the ad they would sell that data to display a more personal ad that makes YouTube more money,1,0,0,1,0

 On the contrary artists can be more creative and free than ever since they will only have their work bought by the true fans who arent just fans of their genre as youre implying but instead are fans of the artists themselves But NFT is advertised as decentralized which means it wont be controlled nor sold through a label if the artist doesnt want so but through the blockchain instead at the artists own promotion Thats what makes NFT special for artists that once they get well known enough they wont need the label to keep 50 of the share for promotionmarketing campaigns since the artist will sell a limited amount at a skyhigh price for people who LIKES them and their work regardless of genre The Chainsmokers beg to differ different genre albums David Guetta begs to differ different genre albums Lil Wayne also put out different genres even rock despite being a rapper and still sold a ton Alesso did too went from EDM to Pop Martin Garrix went from EDM to Pop literally from a big room sound that he was known for to a poppyfuturebass kinda sound So like you see a ton of artists jumped ships and they still kept their fans True fans go with the artist regardless of the musical destination Thats what makes them true fans,1,1,0,1,0

 The currently provided use cases for music NFTs are not convincing as a disruptive technology simply because it doesnt add a lot of real life value yet Im not saying that is not going to change were still at the beginning but copyright ownership currently centralized working system is more economic or the musician only gets 8 percent currently only applies to 001 percent of musicians are not problems that urgently need to be solved NFT can change the music industry vastly but not as currently proposed by NFTshills You are oversimplifying a complex case by saying NFTs are like electric cars new technology is not adopted by the market if it doesnt provide enough value,0,1,0,0,1
 this is an area of experimentation and challenging of the status quo Its unfortunate that when the term NFT is used in conversation there is a knee jerk reaction to automatically think of collectibles which generally dont have much use Creating a platform for musicians to make a living from their craft AND keep their intellectual property is a worth mission that some are willing to take on If its not for you then just move along Discourse is welcome but just flat out saying that a new idea wont work doesnt serve anyone The market will decide if its worthy or not I have a feeling you havent spent much time as a working musician in the music industry Cheers,1,1,0,1,0

 In most countries once you create music it is your IP this term is not really used in music forever You can sell usage rights if you want for example to a brand that uses your music You can also give Spotify the always revokable! right to play your song and give you 70 percent of the income If you choose to sign a contract with a major that only gives you 08 percent of that this was a choice you made a choice people will make in Web3 as well for good reasons In the states there is something called a buyout where you theoretically also sell the IP but this has nothing to do with Spotify and is also only used in very rare occasions like in advertising as I said Now everybody says oh but with NFTs you dont need to give Spotify a cut No you dont but you will pay for the decentralized infrastructure well see how much that will be and also new decentralized platforms want their cut currently 1015 So in this new world you still only get 70 percent NFTs are not magically going to make everyday people spend more than 10 Dollars per month on music so with NFTs there will still be only 7 Dollars for musicians But we own the platforms! do we? Everything in PoS will naturally go towards centralized ledgers as you can currently see with the Solana outage There is potential but the things people are currently perpetuating in regards to music are naive Spotify is not the problem the economical value people are willing to give to music is and Spotify was a catalyst for that,0,1,0,0,1

If they got to know Bitcoin around the release then it wasnt really being heavily pitched as a speculative asset just yet Almost everybody doing it back then were onboard with the idea that it would be useful as currency in some level I mean I do think its fair to say that its staying power is due to it successfully transitioning into a purely speculative asset where its bound by no promises other than making the shareholders rich but it certainly didnt start that way and it could have failed in that transition like NFTs and other crypto garbage did,0,1,0,1,0

At best blockchains are just a glorified database They have a few interesting properties like permissionless insertions and trustless validation Essentially a blockchain is a database that anyone can write to and cannot be tampered with Cryptocurrency is an application of this technology The tamperresistance makes it difficult for a hacker to steal from others or pretend they have money they dont have Sending money is just writing I am sending 3 currency to this other account As long as I have enough currency to cover the transaction itll be accepted and now everyone knows I have 3 less currency than before and the recipient has 3 more NFTs are little messages that say something like this is a thing that exists and sending it to someone else is saying remember that thing it belongs to that account now As long as the thing was still assigned to me that transaction will be accepted and the thing will be assigned to the recipients account Smart contracts are little programs that are written to the blockchain They can be run by other transactions when theyre written to the blockchain I can write a program that says the first person to run this program with the answer to the equation 2x 10 gets 2 currency And as long as I have 2 currency itll be taken from my account and assigned to the program Then if someone else writes a message to the blockchain like Im running that program with the answer 5 theyll receive the 2 currency And well thats about it more or less With that in mind your question becomes is this database platform dead? The answer is complicated First we need to ask why it became so popular Are permissionless writes all that interesting? Not really The internet is already permissionless more or less and theres a reason we tend towards platforms and services that are permissioned being able to revoke permissions avoids spam and abuse The blockchain avoids spam by making writes expensive which works but also makes anything that heavily relies on the blockchain extremely expensive to run leading to most blockchain projects to spin off their own permissioned sidechains to minimise the number of expensive transactions but that also dilates the advantages of the blockchain If your currency is on a permissioned sidechain then you can be locked out of your money if they refuse to process your transactions What about tamperresistance? Sure thats useful but only to a degree With banks if someone steals my credentials and sends themself money from my account the banks have the power to reverse the transaction Now perhaps you dont trust the banks youre afraid they might shut down your account if they dont like you or if your government is corrupt Thats fair but it does mean that on the blockchain whats done is done If money is sent from your account its gone maybe you meant to send that money but the seller never sent you the goods or you accidentally typed an extra 0 or the seller was pretending to be someone else or they got your credentials somehow or they forced you Either way in choosing to not trust the banks youve decided to trust a system that is completely inflexible to the slightest mistake or scam So why did it get so popular? Because it was pushed hard by libertarians and anarchocapitalists who really dont like banks and hate paying taxes even more and it had an excellent getrichquick story It had just enough technobabble to convince semitechnical people that there was some real futuristic stuff going on and there was an opportunity for the luckiest and scummiest to make some good bank off of the hype and lack of regulation Why is it losing popularity? Regulation is starting to hit hard People are going to prison over this Taxation is hitting too when you convert your cryptocurrency back into fiat you have to pay capital gains taxes so you cant avoid taxes with cryptocurrency anymore Blockchains are inefficient its a pain to actually build anything on them and costs go through the roof compared to a good old database Also as a company you want permissions and the ability to tamper with your database Smart contracts are no takebacks if a developer messes up you can lose all of your cryptocurrency in a few seconds with no recourse The only reason companies really cared about blockchains was the fear of missing out and the apparent success of other companies but theyre starting to realise that theyre not missing out on much and because people are way more informed now the only people still making money are the scammers hackers and shovelsellers A company trying to build a legitimate project that uses a blockchain doesnt stand to make much money unless theyre prepared to scam their users and are able to avoid getting hacked,0,1,0,0,1

LabTrace doesnt embed anything in the hardware You upload the data to their cloud server or your private server Once the data is uploaded a hash is taken of that data and its added to a blockchain This model allows a piece of data to be verified against the hash The blockchain entry also asserts ownership and a timestamp of that data However including the file hash in the research paper would achieve the same verification and ownership claim it would also be easier to use because it didnt rely on looking up a blockchain The LabTrace system does not address the fraud problem as the uploaded data could be fraudulent I also disagree with their Immutability claims the data could be modified and a new hash pushed to the blockchain There will be a newer date but no other evidence you just wouldnt tell anyone about the first upload Looking at LabTraces ongoing projects and blog actually reinforces the pointlessness of the blockchain aspect The ongoing projects discusses an integration with Bitbox imaging a medical imaging data transfer system LabTrace seems to be integrating as an additional layer on top of Bitbox the Bitbox whitepaper doesnt mention LabTrace or its blockchain In this scenario its hard to see what LabTrace adds the image is already verified as correct and unmodified by Bitbox the image ownership is also tracked by Bitbox as part of the permission model The blog has a recent project they have joined to watermark data from portable MRI machines No mention of blockchains anywhere in the project description It seems even LabTrace isnt bothering with them any more,0,1,1,0,1

To your second point web3 in terms of how companies like Meta pitch it makes most sense to me by thinking about exclusionary vs nonexclusionary goods That is the web was built as a public park You can say go perform music in the park and anyone walking by can listen to itno one is excluded But it is really hard as a musician to make much money playing in a public part You can basically just put out a hat and hope folks feel compelled to throw a dollar in You cant prevent them from listening and leaving without paying you though The Metaverse and NFTs etc are essentially trying to turn the public park into a private venue where you can sell tickets This does theoretically allow creatives to more easily charge people money for their artcontent but that is really a side effect the venue owners are the ones who get rich But this is not actually a popular problem to solve People love the public park with its free music and news and videos And people hate the idea of converting that park into a private venue So Meta et al spend a lot of time talking to the public about all the cool things that the metaverse will do and about the benefits to artists and creatives and then they tell their shareholders the other side of the story Imagine how much money we will make when we own Central Park I actually think the same thing is largely true about AI hype If Gemini or ChatGPT becomes the filter through which people access the internet it essentially walls off the park in a similair way You no longer go to a reddit thread you go to a summary of various reddit threads via Gemini,0,1,0,0,1
Payments via crypto are far more common in countries with weaker currencies since currencies like Bitcoin have predictable inflation rates and can be used with mobile phones with little friction Adoption of crypto payments in the west has been slow but steady Stripe announced they are supporting crypto payments again this year I agree that speculation is the biggest use case for now though but I expect it will lower over time The biggest use case other than payments is DeFi decentralized finance where distributed networks provide financial services such as trading lending and borrowing The benefit of decentralization for financial services is that the community at large rather than a centralized entity can dictate the direction of the service Since everything is open source and transparent users can also be assured that a centralized entity cannot do something malicious to their funds like change the rules of how the platform operates or even steal their funds Additionally many believe that financial services should be available to everyone that wants to use them censorshipresistance though I think even traditional finance firms that pick and choose who to serve will continue to integrate with blockchains because they can settle transfers of value with less friction and trust required than centralized financial databases,1,0,0,1,0

Over the last few years we have developed numerous business ideas in the company that are based on blockchain technology Almost every idea has failed due to legal hurdles The problem nowadays is that you very quickly find yourself in the area of securities transactions which makes the cost of testing the idea on the market extremely high The second problem especially in the EU is that transactions now require KYC which makes many of the advantages of blockchain technology absurd again In the end the effort is just considerably higher to achieve the same result that could be achieved just as well with traditional databases,0,1,1,0,1
idk man I believe we are facing new obstacles with the regulations but this is for good KYC is really a must the thing is that we need to use technology to make KYC decentralized like using zeroknowledge and stuff If your application is fully noncustodial how its meant to be you will have fewer legal problems can you share which problems might occur?,0,0,0,1,1

gtIt would be nice if I could deposit 5 into an account every month and every paymentflagged article that I knowingly click on gave the content creator 005 The 5 transfer both limits my maximum cost and prevents doing a real financial transaction with overhead and fees for every article There is still a risk of fraudulent clickbot scripts draining my 5 into some assholes account on day #1 I have thought about that for a long time Its so hard to make any significant amount of money online without turning online content into a full time job Stuff like Patreon is a good start but theres still a minimum amount they take a nontrivial percentage and its not realistic to send a one time payment of pennies Its kind of dumb all the technology we need is there in different ways youd just need enough people to buy into the same system I think you are generally right about the broker thing You send X to a brokerage site where content producers register The content producers cite their brokerage account name andor put a button on their website which uses the broker API kind of like visa has pay buttons on some sites The user clicks the button and decides how much they want to send Instead of sending money directly from you to the content provider the payments from all customers are aggregated dailyweekly and sent as one transaction That way instead of millions of 005 transactions you effectively reduce it to one external transaction Having a time delay allows people to monitor their dailyweekly contributions and protects people from contributing anything other than what they want Having the money in brokerage lets people set a hard limit on their spending I would try to to make the company myself but seriously contemplating doing a fintech startup somehow drains the life out of me and I have to lay down for a minute But for real we dont need entirely new web architecture Maybe there are some legal barriers I dont know but I dont see any hurdles which cant be overcome,0,0,0,1,1

Can you point to any authoritative source that defines web3 that way?

Ive been working as a fullstack engineer in Web3 for 25 years now In a validation team for a POS chain From my experience web3 is just 99 scam Startups at the very top are only looking for a way to get the VC money The VCs are interested to invest because the chance of making good profits is more and fast compared to traditional investments when the tokens shoot up The tech actually solves nothing Its just more complexity over complexity Services over services You got L1s but they are too slow so you bring L2s Almost everything is standing on VC money and VCs are happy with it Its only the common people who lose the money Its a cycle without an end The only confidence is BTC Web3 isnt going anywhere till BTC has value I got into Web3 because I actually liked the idea of NFTs To actually own your intellectual property digitally is a great thing But now I think we could actually have a protocol for it much better than a blockchain Blockchain is expensive and not useful for common usecases ,0,1,1,0,1

There are interesting things happening but they are going to be small startups and teams Most big companies more than 5 employees in web3 are just exchanges or trading platforms which are ultimately incentivized to not be innovative For example I worked at a startup for the past year that created a card game similar to Cards Against Humanity where the cards from the inperson game linked to a web platform with no NFTs involved It was like a micropayment survey platform where you get paid to vote on questions that other people ask I now work for a physical arcade that exists in the real world USA building a softwarehardware integration for a new kind of arcade cabinet that can earn tokens while youre playing games On both of these projects Im the sole fulltime engineer with only contracting others for short sprints,0,1,0,1,0

my last company was a regulated crypto exchange i joined a couple years after the first NFT proposal was put together i joined because i thought and still do think smart contracts have real potential things like portable identity cryptographic assurance by default radical decentralization trustless compute are all things that dont have good solutions outside of blockchains likewise NFTs lost a lot of credibility during their hype cycle but they do have real utility outside of speculating on JPGs ownership records for realworld assets like fine art or real estate is a good example ingame p2p marketplaces think the World of Warcraft auction house is another IPFS is another good innovation born out of blockchain tech its far from perfect but the idea of decentralized storage is sound and its catalyzed quite a few new ideas DAOs are my favourite though trustless governance was simply not possible prior to smart contracts the alternative is elaborate systems of trusted human actors backed by even more elaborate systems of checks and balances all of which ultimately rely on trust in the justice system a system that is extremely expensive to use for dispute resolution all that said i agree with your view of things the echo chamber is strong and almost everyone involved seems to be trying to monetize hype rather than maturing the technology for mainstream use cases by the time i left my last company my role in that weighed heavily on my soul people dont care if the apps they buysubscribe to are using postgres or mongodb under the hood but because of all the shameful shit thats gone on in the crypto space they absolutely will care if they use blockchains under the hood its a shame because things like DAOs and IPFS and NFTs could bring real value to the average persons life,1,1,0,1,0
gt ownership records for realworld assets like fine art or real estate is a good example ingame p2p marketplaces think the World of Warcraft auction house is another Anything relating to real world ownership makes even less sense The NFT has no authority over the real world and any such connection inherently depends on trusting a third party either directly or in the form of an oracle Real estate is especially stupid as it needs to be tracked by central authority anyways if you want enforceable records And of course permissionless auth is inherently catastrophically errorprone what happens when someone inevitably loses the key or has it stolen? If the central authority can override the chain as they must in such cases then the NFT is providing zero value gt IPFS is another good innovation born out of blockchain tech its far from perfect but the idea of decentralized storage is sound and its catalyzed quite a few new ideas IPFS predates blockchain tech and does not require or depend on it gt DAOs are my favourite though trustless governance was simply not possible prior to smart contracts the alternative is elaborate systems of trusted human actors backed by even more elaborate systems of checks and balances all of which ultimately rely on trust in the justice system a system that is extremely expensive to use for dispute resolution Same problem as above it can have no authority over anything offchain without external trust anyways and the same issues with permissionless auth being catastrophically errorprone Only now you have the added problem of smart contracts depending on people to write magically bugfree code because if you dont it fails catastrophically in new and exciting ways and failures cant be rolled back restored reverted Any abstraction you add to enable that is just reinventing more external or centralized trust In many ways its fair to say that the reason the tech doesnt work is that its proponents have a catastrophically poor understanding of how trust actually works in real world systems,0,1,0,0,1

I developed the blockchain strategy years go for a large healthcare enterprise They were certain that it was going to impact them and they wanted to start investing My conclusion was that they should ignore it The problem with block chain is that it is complicated Very few people understand it It solves problem of trust but that isnt what most people use it for They kept want to use it to solve things like interoperability for which there are better cheaper solutions And while there are plenty of trust issues in healthcare you run into the next set of problems The next things are that it depends on the network effect to drive value One entity can drive but ultimately you need to get the other parties of the trust relationship to work together They dont do that well in healthcare or many other things Worse in healthcare it is often not legal to Patients might want their medical records to be protected by the block chain m the providers might too but the insurer might not and the government has laws that require me to be able to produce records which I could do if they were all protected by the block chain Then what you saw everyone trying to build solutions was effectively breaking it by centralizing a key part of it They were all doing it for their benefit or ease or control but always with an impact on trust which is the whole point Finally I concluded that due to the complexity and the cost of building network effect that it didnt make sense for them to invest because it would take such a long time to get a return on investment likely never and that most likely newer technologies would emerge to solve any of the problems that blockchain was trying to solve before it could get enough critical mass for the network effect to kick in And finally that if there were going to be winners then they should buy it as part of something integrated into the software and not develop it on their own I know at the time some of the other player had a very different take than I did but this type of analysis could also explain why only VCs are using it and why they also keep screwing it up It is kind of a shame because it is one of those technologies that could be life changing if it was mastered but I dont believe it ever will be other than in a few niche usages We might get a whole bunch of things called block chain but really arent but otherwise other things will win out,0,1,0,0,1
I mean I think that decentralized compute could be the next revolution after the cloud revolution I just dont see any big need or motivation right now that would make it worthwhile for most corpos to undertake such a major change Right now the big data centers are trustworthy enough Maybe in a future where data centers are under attack or where governments are really choking them with taxes or regulations or something But its just not worth making all of the tough tradeoffs for that right now,0,1,0,1,0

Lets address your points in order gt I cant shake the fact that all our clients are other vcbacked blockchainweb3crypto startups and sales and leadership is making no effort to sell to nonweb3 prospects Yes most of crypto points at itself This is for 2 reasons 1 For anything onchain the chain itself is the authoritative source of data For most RWA it isnt it needs an oracle While I have heard of things like car deeds being placed on chain its rarer for the blockchain to become the primary truth of data Without that you need an oracle Oracles are expensive and complicated things 2 Im sure youre aware that theres been a lot of regulation by enforcement against crypto Recently the SEC issued a wells notice against opensea which is basically like claiming a digital pokeman card becomes a security the moment you put it on chain In such a hostile environment the most widespread projects are those without external touch points the government can come after gt Isnt the point of blockhainweb3 enabled tech to solve problems other companies have that existing technology is not able to address? Able or not crypto does many things that those solutions havent addressed well yet Point to point transfers across borders forex with lower fees markets that are online 247 money markets with unusually high revenue compared to tradfi Tradfi does all of these things to an extent but blockchain offerings do them better Sometimes the solution is also just offering access to things like stablecoins that governments dont want their citizens to use because it threatens their control gt Another point web3 enthusiasts previously made was that blockchain based tech will eliminate single powerful players but it just seems like companies are coming up with ways to extract as much value like they always do by deploying their own wallets or their own custom chains built on top of public ones Blockchain guarantees equality of opportunity not equality of outcome By contrast banks have a direct account at the Federal Reserve You cant get one In most blockchain offerings everyone outside of some admin functions can use the system equally Nothing about this stops the accumulation of power especially as we frequently use money as a Sybilresistance mechanism Im also not sure why you think something like a Coinbase wallet or Base L2 on top of Ethereum somehow makes Ethereum less decentralized Adding optionality isnt a problem even if that option ends up dominating the market share unless youre talking about something like Geth gt Everything seems like a big echo chamber What would change this in your viewpoint? RWAs? Look at what Centrifuge or Sky previously Maker have done Stablecoin adoption? Its at an ATH Institutional adoption? See ETFs or Blockrocks BUIDL But you seem to actively complain about institutions because of centralization threats So I guess choose your poison here gt Right now crypto and nfts have been around for a good amount of time and nobody I know outside the web3 community actually uses these beyond bitcoin being a small portion of their investments Stablecoins are used a lot in places like Venezuela that are otherwise illserved by their banking systems I personally use them to access high interest options and it continues to surprise me that more money hasnt flooded into these opportunities to dilute the yield If you want some better potential use cases of NFTs specifically read this gt Is web3 just a house of cards waiting to collapse?

The existing buyers of blockspace would only abandon the use of blockchains if the profit opportunities go away I only see the number of opportunities generally expanding over the years I see no reason it would collapse now,0,1,0,1,0
Ecosystems dont change in an instant Part of this is how Web3 companies present themselves and part of it is a lack of substance There are a lot of uses but the main purpose for me is decentralization and ownership in a digital world UI needs to improve and value needs to be conveyed but it should also be mentioned that the regulatory system and infrastructure more broadly is not equipped to handle a paradigm shift like this All but the strongest companies try and stay out of legal limbo There have been a number of high profile cases won by Web3 companies against regulatory commissions and well see more in the future but its going to be a process,0,1,0,1,1

Its understandable to feel that Web3 might be losing steam especially given the hype cycles around emerging technologies However Web3 and blockchain development are far from dead In fact the technology is evolving and finding applications beyond just crypto and NFT trading There are still many companies actively hiring Web3 developers as they explore various realworld use cases For example CLAPART is a revolutionary platform in this space focusing on transforming how artists and fans interact through tokenization and decentralized finance This kind of innovation shows that Web3 is being applied in meaningful ways beyond traditional crypto apps Web3 is integrating into sectors like art entertainment and beyond proving that the technology has staying power and is continuously evolving If youre interested in the future of digital interactions and blockchain applications Web3 is definitely worth exploring,1,0,0,1,0
Nope Only the hype has passed Now is the time to dig down and make some valuable products on the blockchain because as with all tech innovation cycles they start with hype followed by a cull of all the bad ideas along with a retreat back to the white board then after a winter period they return with a matured platform slick implementations and better products that create real value It happens every time Dont sleep through winter!,1,1,0,0,0

gt Isnt the point of blockhainweb3 enabled tech to solve problems other companies have that existing technology is not able to address? This would be better asked in a crypto sub rather than a dev sub That being said I dont like the term web3 its far too general of a term for me but I do use several things I guess that would be considered web3 For example Thorchain for cross chain crypto swaps This is better than the conventional method of depositing your crypto with a company to exchange it and then having to withdraw again often taking a fee to do that plus having to go through hoops of KYC just to open an account This is more involved than say opening a share dealing account due to heavy handed regulations Once theyve exchanged it it people end up keeping it on the exchange and when you least expect it the exchange gets hacked or the company goes bust and now your crypto is lost these are very real risk so being able to swap whilst retaining your crypto in a self custody manner is valuable Another is lending and borrowing on protocols like Aave Biggest advantage Ive seen so far is it essentially gets treated like super senior debt Theres no way to negotiate on the debt in the event of say a bankruptcy and so the borrower whether its a company or individual will have to pay this off first or post more collateral Ive seen this first hand with companies that went bankrupt like Celsius As they were facing bankruptcy their first call was to address all the defi loans they had or face having to give up huge amounts of crypto they posted as collateral Another is around gaming still very much in the early phases but we see Sony essentially working on their own Blockchain Main appeal would be the ability to self custody things like avatars weapons skins and other gaming assets and freely trade it on any Blockchain based market place they like and no need to resort to crazy methods like selling entire accounts just to do it Granted some bigger games have kept things centralised and have created their own marketplaces or opted to use some sort of third party company to do this To me web3 is less about solving problems for companies and more about addressing problems for crypto users hence maybe why your company doesnt really try to reach out to conventional companies that probably need a debrief on the basics of this market That being said it will be highly dependant on what your employer actually does,0,1,0,1,1
Im not in web3 myself but I long have thought that Web3 itself a real advancement that has been surrounded by a lot of fluff and scam artists The first to ask yourself is what is the main benefit of the browser? Think about it People nowadays just click links without thinking The browser provides a secure runtime that the operating system just cant The software that browsers execute are known to be secure If they are found to be insecure today they can be made secure tomorrow Second the browser is the best distribution platform created by humanity This is because the venn diagram that combines both the number of people who have computers and the number of people who have browsers is quite nearly a circle There are approximately 54 billion people using browsers today Now comes the third part how do you transact data securely in any environment? Only the operating system can do that task The task of asking you This product is asking to take your money can you confirm that was you? If you think of a browser as an operating system itself then its the most widely distributed secure environment there is If you can build trust around transactions on top of browsers that on its own is a great advancement But you add the fact that crypto transactions themselves are distributed and the whole idea starts to make sense This is because at that point no major large entity is involved in the transaction only the seller and the buyer The major OS are not involved no major financial institution is involved not even the web3 company as per algorithm they can only facilitate the transaction whereas are not themselves involved either like a catalist The space is full of scam artists and speculators today though Until someone figures out a way to get rid of them the idea wont work Add to that the name implies a new web instead of a new web technology and it makes the whole space feel more like a marketing ploy than anything else,0,1,0,1,1
You right On the other hand I think blockchain technology can be useful but without all this cryptobros hype around For example the documents flow I know one company that uses it and they are satisfied Cryptocurrencies could be also pretty nice thing I kina liked what Kim Stanley Robinson proposed in his book Ministry for the Future a crypto coin which value is based on carbon emission reduction I wont be able to cover this idea in details here Nevertheless even if crypto things could be nice I think as you mentioned our society is focused on making money no matter what and what cost so someone will find a way to exploit it some big players will emerge they will take advantage of the solution and earn shit tones of money,0,1,0,1,1
I am working in a crypto startup as well and can agree 100 The most interesting thing I have seen so far was a crypto project that would have a dApp running on your phone counting your steps and you would get rewarded with their tokens for having lots of steps And quite frankly this is just stupid and I cannot understand how this is a business case Crypto is a wildfire living from VC and retail pump and dump You are either dumping or you are being dumped Is is all a hoax Except Bitcoin That is legit,0,1,1,0,0
Blockchain is a technology that is waiting for the economic collapse which is not so far away That is why Bitcoin reached 70K in 2021 However now the big players such as investment funds banks and governments are in the game They are quietly working to migrate financial markets to blockchain technology When this happens blockchain will come back stronger than ever Most people talk about blockchain without really understanding the economics they are the masses buying AI stocks and NFTs at all time highs following trends without real knowledge,0,1,0,0,1
crypto does absolutely fuck all about power players cause real property is still all controlled by a large hierarchical wealth systems the only thing remotely useful that we might apply from crypto chains are building public data structures we can use to make provable claims without revealing all the information about those proofs for example we can build a public voting database where we can prove everyone votes and we can prove the ends results but we cannot prove who specifically voted for what i cant say i understand the math myself but u can lookup zero knowledge proofs regardless of what side ur on for the jan 6th fiasco we can literally math our way out that for future situations,0,1,0,1,0

its certainly overhyped compared to the recent nvidiaml bubble bitcoin as a whole is a proven tech that has largely done what it was made to do a decentralized monetary system that allows money to be sent without a central authority there are some use cases in which that is important other blockchains focus more on performance or privacy to fit other use cases payment processors might not work with businesses who do adult content toys arts this can be good when it got the hub to clean up their act but it does also impact people who have always be compliant with the law im less familiar with other countries but ive heard some places with more unstable currencies and less access to banking crypto has potentially helped i dont think its useless but i always caution against falling for hype,0,1,0,1,1

Swift is traditionally for that area yes But its also expensive slow and gets exploited a lot in the underbanked countries mentioned above Many of those countries residents cant get much better than losing 612 of their cash and thats on a good day when sending it home as there are many more rent seekers in between The solution to this broadly speaking is doing wholesale money in tradfi because you can take advantages of scale optimisations and discounts but doing retail transfers in web3 Another thing web3 solves better than the traditional banking sector is the ability to exchange one currency to another almost instantly and at negligible cost depending on chain this is not the reality in tradfi This particular detail really helps countries that have inflationarydeflationary currencies so they can switch into a better performing currency while holding it then switch back to their national currency when going to spend it,1,1,0,0,1

Right web3 doesnt solve problems for businesses its a technology for the people in that really the only problem blockchain solves at its core is trust That is generally a problem for people not businesses In todays society people must trust 3rd parties by and large to operate and companies make money off being that 3rd party providing trust Thats why people believe there is so much opportunity for disruption Now you say its inherently part of society and people are just fine with it This is cultural and regional though Over time though as the tech continues to mature and you can bank without needing to trust some 3rd party not to over leverage itself or trade assets without needing to trust and pay some middleman why would anybody choose the more expensive riskier option?

I have some anecdotical examples on why blockchain with this would be better The example dates back to germany Alot of people had to flee east germany before the wall was created which split germany in half Alot of houses were empty and were then distributed to other citizen in east germany After the wall fell all the people who had a house wanted their house back but they didnt had time to flee with their papers or the papers got destroyed in the registry essentially making it impossible to proof that they had ownership over the house How would have had blockchain solved this? its just that the blockchain would be an indestructable log of ownership A simple Alice owns house at foostreet 20 as a logmessage signed off by the old state of germany would have been enough What if the government goes rogue? In this case the government would issue updates giving someone else the property right Now it would read Alice gives the house at foostreet 20 to bob doesnt matter if legit or not How would this solve the problem? Because the moment the rogue government gets thrown out and a new government takes place you could just sue the state to fix the mistake of the old government via court which they can just do by appending another line to the log Iam not saying that this entry will help you in case that a government goes rogue Because it doesnt But it will help in the future when the government is replaced Also the moment something is digitalized like that you could automate quite alot here to make buying a house much easier to do I know the process of buying a house and i had to pay an intermediate to facilitate the exchange All could be automated,1,0,0,1,0
Anything which is not provable immutable is not a good solution imo If its on a DB then the rogue government could delete it without any issues You can solve this by going the open data route but then it needs to be provable that the government tapered with it You can do this with auditing hashes whatnot but in that case you would rebuild a blockchain kind of Also if its in a government blockchain you can host many applications in a single chain which makes it also easier to track for citizen because its in a single place and you get all the node infrastructure for free EDIT iam not saying you need a blockchain but a blockchain would be a nice and elegant solution to the problem because you get the important characteristics completly for free immutability smartcontracts to get rid of intermediates transparency Also if you have such a setup you can start paying your politicians via the chain pay your government workers etc It would be completely transparent on what your taxes are spend on I think its a cool idea but ofc it will never be implemented because it would be just to costly to switch to that completely EDIT2 gt open database you could download be much easier Open DB would be interesting but then hackers could ddos it etc For blockchain it would be kind of more secure because you can host multiple nodes easily in different data centers sure you can shard a DB but that would be much harder to do then just using a blockchian which again has this data redudancy thing already implement for free,0,1,0,0,1

It basically just owning a row in a database In digital worlds that can be anything Plus the creator can get a cut when its sold I fully agree the current iteration of NFTs lead to a lot of bad press but Im still excited what it can do for gaming or virtual worlds To me there is a line between NFTs and NFT Technology so I get people autodown vote me but end of the day whats going to drive web3 is NFT Technology Personally I love the idea of a creator of a digital item to get a commission for the things they sell Especially gamemods,1,1,0,1,0
Again NTF JPGs are a poor example of the tech Think owning a UUID on the blockchain thats the basic of the technology The issue with NFTJPGs is that to put a large image on the blockchain would lead to high gas fees That would kill the liquidity of NFTs So they put NFTs in the cloud The NFT would just store the URL if anything of the image The problem is the owner of that bucket can just swap the image Since JPG is an open format it can just be saved so the exclusivity is non existent Like the ideal scenario would be the music industry this will never happen that if playing a song was like assigning an NFT to a user When that happens the artist of the song gets a royalty Then when a person is done with the music they can sell it to their friend and the artist gets a commission NFTs can change how people are reimbursed for digital goods So trying to say how does NFTs do this established model better is a poor framing because they can take whatever transaction model that exists and reframe it I would also say that there will be improvements around it as the blockchain models are established Like something like an oracle for file storage do files without incurring high fees on each transaction,0,1,0,1,0
gtThis is pure gobbledygook Ya this is what I am saying if you assume current models it doesnt make sense because of our current models But there is a current system for collecting royalties However historically royalty lawsuits are common and painful because the amount of auditing that needs to happen If you asked an artist what they wanted in an ideal would they would get PPU with something that was built into an MP3 even if it was a 10th of a penny without having to trust the record company Based off your questions that you dont know what a blockchain oracle is i know writing more is just waste of my time as you arent open to learning more on your own and I not trying to change anyones mind In blockchain systems you can have these add ons to the eco system This is also why BTC is a poor example of what crypto really is even tho its the most basic example With smart contracts they can be conditional on external sources These sources could be a web API However this can be complicated due to network traffic being effect by regions So there needs to be a mechanism to retrieve that data and determine if that result is the true result So if another miner checks a transaction that the data can be verified against the oracle and not real time data So when I said an oracle for file storage I meant a formal file storage mechanism that doesnt require more gas fees when an NFT changes hands but would built using low trust protocols this may already exist in a road map I just dont know the formal name,0,1,0,1,0
gt Like the ideal scenario would be the music industry this will never happen that if playing a song was like assigning an NFT to a user When that happens the artist of the song gets a royalty Then when a person is done with the music they can sell it to their friend and the artist gets a commission Youre just reinventing DRM with extra steps at that point and it requires enforcement in the client just like any other form of DRM And many of us dont see any expansion of DRM as a positive gt Then when a person is done with the music they can sell it to their friend and the artist gets a commission This doesnt work well in practice as most NFT markets have shown You cant differentiate between sale vs transfer without making it easy to bypass people can just set the price to zero and pay separately you have the usual update issues with smart contracts what happens when the artist inevitably needs to change the target addresses what happens when someones key is inevitably compromised etc etc These are intrinsic issues and you cant get around them without making the tech work more and more like conventional systems ie reinventing the wheel with extra steps gt Like something like an oracle The entire concept of an oracle in this space only highlights how unavoidable external trust actually is,0,1,0,0,1
Yes its a trade off Payment processors still make PPU expensive to merchants and you still have price minimums You can trade 100 tokens that are less than a penny a payment processor doesnt want that transaction but for a few minutes of cloud processing could be less than a penny If you have a game where you want some sort of real economy but keep the amounts low then web3 starts to make sense Part of what makes this stuff toxic is the constraints of the current economy This way smaller hobby projectsgames can achieve their goals without predatory practices Because basically when you have games where you get a lot for a penny the games economy is highly inflated Whatever currency in that game is leftover you cant buy anything you cant get out of the game for a penny and you gotta buy more of whatever Like EVE did a good job of trying to solve this problem but creating a real currency has a lot of overhead,0,1,0,1,0
gtIf you have a game where you want some sort of real economy but keep the amounts low then web3 starts to make sense If you have such a game you can use a database and ingame transactions are free They figured that out 30 years ago Again its a solution without a problem to solve because all related problems were already solved much better ages ago,0,1,0,0,0
Yes but if you dont want it to be in a single db its exciting I love the idea that another game may take my ownership of an NFT and give me a bonus in another game The two companies dont need to agree to work together This gives the consumer a lot of power Like if there was an exclusive zone in a game that you can only access if you have achievements on NFT in another game NTFs offer new ways of doing things which I find exciting Especially with smart contracts,1,0,0,1,0
gt if there was an exclusive zone in a game that you can only access if you have achievements on NFT in another game Wouldnt there need to be code specifically to allow this? And if so the company would have to pay their programers and designers to make it happen And that means the companies would have to coordinate with each other in some way Youre basically describing an API which does require both sides to agree to a contract,0,1,0,1,0
They would have to decide on what to expose to the blockchain But the benefit would be there wouldnt be any new work Blockchain is basically a public database But there doesnt require any agreement as blockchain is for low trust environment Like if you were Sony and you agree to share UUIDs with Epic If they made a game made lots of money but Sony wants to pull the plug epic would lose all that investment and players would lose their time amp money potentially By going blockchain with that sort of stuff is a clear signal to consumers that will have some ownership of those assets Therefore if the game goes away then the NFT can still be sold regardless if the game still exists If someone is feeling nostalgic all those NFT records are still there they could build a new game or build a spiritual successor to it Personally I hate my stuff I bought in games is only in their db I wish I had some way to show I had a level cap character in a dead game even if it was bragging rights,1,0,0,1,0
The incentive would be to put a commission into the smart contract Everytime that NFT changes hands the writer of the smart contract will get a cut through gas fees,1,0,0,1,0
gt Therefore if the game goes away then the NFT can still be sold regardless if the game still exists Tying real life monetary systems to ingame assets is exactly the thing a lot of players dont want in the first place by its very nature that kind of thing is toxic to game design as the player can no longer trust that a design choice was made to make the game more fun vs lining pockets It creates perverse incentives for game devs and empowers players with the most money And ultimately it means whatever the client or server says it means anyways The chain has no unilateral authority Again these are conceptual issues not problems with the tech being immature This is ignoring the mountain of over issues with the tech of course like how permissionless auth is catastrophically errorprone for individuals,0,1,0,0,1
Again it solves the wrong problem NFTs are about the worst way to solve the problem you propose It would be easier for every game to simply have a public API to expose the achievements of a user Like the Steam API already does Oops turns out your problem has already been solved for a decade or more Number of games that take advantage of this feature? Zero to my knowledge If it happens at all its pretty rare The problem youre trying to solve is one that basically no game developer wants to solve The only reason a game developer might want to do that is to promote someone elses game anyway So the game companies working together wouldnt exactly be hard to arrange A solution looking for a problem indeed,0,1,1,0,0
Steam is still owned by valve Blockchain is owned by the people Blockchain can exist with only two nodes Besides the example i give is just how to plug into existing systems Smart contracts can provide new ways of doing business not yet imagined just by it being decentralized and low trust But thats the beauty of this if you want to make agreements and use other key holders tech you can Sure most mainstream game developers dont want this its just an example of something one could take advantage of if people are open to storing things as NFTs Like saying no one wants this is like saying no one wants to spend money on apps but yet now we have the apple store This is all a platform so to me its like saying that clay has no potential because ya i havent formed it into a plate yet Show someone you can make a vase from the same clay and they scream i thought you make plates from clay,1,0,0,1,0

Its 100 dependent on companies implementing something that doesnt make much conceptual or economic sense and even then its unclear what value this is supposed to offer to the consumer either It doesnt offer ownership if thats what you want to imply as the NFT is nothing but a token it means whatever the servergame client says it means,0,1,0,0,1

In Blockchain we pay a tremendous price for redundancy remove the need for a centralized third party to hold the data On the other hand Blockchain is an incomplete solution to verifying the authenticity of records checking signatures You always need some version of PKI to establish the trust that someone stands behind a public key Blockchain if deployed so does provide decentralization But at a price impractically high for many use cases It is a very tiny niche,0,1,0,0,1
You actually dont need to verify that someone with a private key made each transaction because it is quite impossible for someone to make a transaction from a public address unless they have signed the transaction so every transaction you see has been verified Another thing is that reading data is always free on a blockchain so if you want to double check anything like that some data was signed correctly its free,1,0,0,1,0
Blockchain verifies ledger integrity see the original Satoshi 2008 paper It verifies that there is no doublespending Bitcoin originally did it via Unspent Transaction Outputs UTXO Ethereum later did it differently In that sense youre right What people refer to when they say that Blockchain is solving an already solved problem is that a plethora of legacy technologies already keep the ledger integrity very well And they just like you are right Blockchains added value is that it does so with decentralized control not a single party can independently modify the ledger This typically does not hold in legacy technologies Some will argue that we want centralized control to recover from catastrophic events eg stolen funds What Im talking about here is verifying the identity of the sender and receiver Blockchain cant do that and it is a dealbreaking requirement in payment systems Blockchain relies on legacy techniques for user verification in practice Some argue that centralized user verification ie virtually all legacy systems for that purpose makes blockchain centralized These are wrong Blockchain itself does not require user verification It is the law that does,0,1,0,1,0
In order to submit a transaction you must sign it with your private key This guarantees that any transaction you see on the blockchain that comes from a public address is always the same person There is nothing better than that,1,0,0,1,0
Of course there are many things better than that These better things are even enforced by law It is called identity verification You are confusing cryptographic signature verification with identity verification These are two separate concepts You can verify a cryptographic signature and still learn nothing about someones identity Furthermore one person may hold many keys and one key may belong to many persons To comply with regulations a payment system must verify a persons identity Blockchain does not help there It is a wellunderstood problem and a longstanding consensus in blockchain research,0,1,0,1,0
If you want to prove an actual human owns a key you can have them sign a message offchain which is free This is how most decentralized websites have users create user account The thing you are trying to solve for however is not a bug its a feature Linking actual human beings to addresses is not important or desired in MOST cases In most cases people would rather be anonymous unless there is a need to prove who they are to someone And in that case it can be done privately between the parties concerned Now IF you want to link something like a drivers license to someone then you can have humans log into a government office and create individual accounts and link public addresses in the private government database to those drivers licenses If you look into Worldcoin this is actually what they are doing with retina scans at inperson locations,0,1,0,1,0
Again signing a message onchain or offchain does not provide identity verification but message authenticity Message authenticity signature checking and identity verification are separate concepts Dont confuse the lack of identity verification with anonymity Blockchain is neither one It does not provide identity verification and it is not anonymous Anonymity requires unlinkability property Blockchain signatures are easily linkable Thats why you have Bitcoin mixers for instance And the question of the mixers legality is still open Public blockchains are not private in any sense gtNow IF you want to link something like a drivers license  First the law requires identity verification Its not a matter of opinion Second there are at least two issues with the described system 1 it roots trust in centralized institutions affecting the main added value of blockchain and 2 you need a separate PKI Public Key Infrastructure As I said blockchain does not help there in any sense,0,1,0,0,1
I really dont know what problem youre trying to solve Blockchain solves the problems it solves extremely well Thats why trillions of dollarlike value is moved around on it Those problems are how you move assets around globally and securely as well as being able to check the provenance of those assets Now we can also do that with arbitrary data which is awesome It seems like you both care about identity and dont Its both too anonymous and not anonymous enough for you I think what youre looking for is not something that people who use blockchains are concerned with We create private keys and we can manage the assets we own Thats what we care about I cant figure out what it is that you want but identity was never a problem bitcoin was intending to solve let alone ethereum If someone has lead you to believe that blockchains fundamentally have something to do with human identity verification I think you have been mislead Blockchains can be used as a tool in a larger identity verification system but that is not their primary use case Blockchains were never made to verify identities Also this statement is false you need a separate PKI Public Key Infrastructure You actually dont need a separate public key infrastructure because the private and public key information necessary to verify any arbitrary message completely exists onchain That is a core competency of a blockchain You can google that if you dont believe me Blockchains and the tooling around blockchain tech is very good at signing messages whether thats moving bitcoin or some arbitrary 4 paragraph letter The great thing about blockchains is that they then save those signatures in a blockchain for all time allowing you to verify the integrity of any data In a decentralized blockchain both parties can be trusted because verifying can verify signed data against a public address which every one has on a blockchain and the signer cannot delete the old signature and replace it with a new one while no one is looking This is the key to two way trust with public and private keys If you didnt know when you create a wallet on any blockchain youre actually just making a public and private key You keep the pivate key that is your wallet The public address is your public key People just call them wallets in an attempt to make them more friendly EDIT It occurs to me that the problem youre trying to solve might be some legal problem?

Let me repeat cryptographic signatures and identity verification are two separate problems Identity verification is a problem that Blockchain does not address Identity verification is strictly enforced by law in payment systems to prevent money laundering One cant put it more straightforward than that I never said Blockchain is too anonymous I said the opposite Blockchain is not anonymous at all It is not anonymous and it is not private it is not anonymous because there are no formal guarantees that a curious third party cannot trace your transactions and attribute them to you Law enforcement does it every day On the other hand there is no mechanism for you to prove your identity You rely on traditionally centralized models of trust that have nothing to do with blockchain gtAlso this statement is false you need a separate PKI Public Key Infrastructure  You confuse PKI with cryptographic signatures PKI serves to establish trust in public keys The statement is true and widely accepted even in the Blockchain community Im unaware that anyone denies it Political debates Id leave out of rwebdev,0,1,0,1,0

gtIts that every micropayment system created thus far has resulted in massive money laundering fraud criminal activity etc The problem isnt solved with more engineers its solved with more compliance officers security analysts and lawyers And that makes it prohibitively expensive And that has stopped from existing Patreon or GofundMeKickstarter Venmo Cash App or crypto based companies or phone app games or the fine art world? If money is moving hands someone will try to abuse it thats just how money is I think trying to launder money through millionsbillions of five cents payments from millions of accounts just doesnt make sense any way you cut it because you still need to involve the normal financial system If youre trying to move more money from fewer accounts then its the same as any other payment service In any case its all still as trackable as any online payments and you generally know where money is coming from and where its going At this point there are a dozen easier more anonymous ways to move larger amounts of money faster with less oversight and interference If you want to move a few thousand or a few million of illegal funds youre going to do it with crypto these days Nearly everything Ive seen about funding content online comes down to friction in payments high overhead from payment processors which makes tiny payments unfeasible and really just not many people wanting to go through the hassle of makingprocessingacknowledging a penny transaction The idea is just to minimize the pertransaction overhead from payment processing There are already multiple companies who are doing each half of the equation but for some reason no one is doing the whole system which would make penny sized payments possible,0,1,0,0,1

gt Patreon or GofundMeKickstarter Venmo Cash App Im talking about true micropayments those pennysized payments You outlined the problems with that for me in the rest of your comment True micropayments require circumventing the payment processors Doing that means you have to handle security yourself which is a nightmare unless youve already got a billion in the bank Nobody is doing the whole system because thats where the concept breaks down There have been multiple attempts at true micropayment systems and none of them could handle the massive fraud on their own And just because criminal organizations have crypto doesnt mean they wont swarm like sharks on chum if a naive startup gives them an easy mark,0,1,0,0,1
gt Youre really not making any points about why micro transactions are particularly high risk Ill be more clear The payment processors charge too much per transaction to make micropayments viable You cannot process a 003 transaction if Visa then charges 008 at minimum Therefore micropayments require their own internal processing and therefore their own internal fraud investigation litigation security analysis and enough connections to law enforcement to be able to do anything about it The existing payment processors have solved these problems by throwing a ton of resources and time at the problem Anyone who wants to process micropayments would be reinventing the world Which is an enormous task that if they werent on the level of the existing processors unlikely they would be taken advantage of immediately The only systems that have managed to make it somewhat work are closed systems that manage an internal currency like gaming and camsites But generalizing that functionality is different beast,0,1,0,0,1
I see where the confusion is then With the brokerage being proposed there are no actual micro transactions being performed only virtual micro transactions The user still has to put whole dollars into the brokerage account using regular payment processors The penny payments are assigned on the brokerage site The broker aggregates all the micro payments during a time period into one lump sum and pays the content producer along with with an itemized list of contributors The broker could just dictate that the outward payment has to be more than a certain amount to cover processing fees otherwise they hold the money in trust The assumption is that the people making micro payments are going to be make a lot of them to various parties The users pay in five dollars or whatever up front and divvy that out to tens or hundreds of content providers over any amount of time Thats how you turn millions of micro payments into one payment without having to actually redo all the work that other payment processors have done Patreon already has almost everything in place to do exactly that They already have most of the infrastructure and the business relationships to say give use 5 and you can pay 4xx content producers The difference is becoming an actual broker which is probably not trivial but could potentially bring in tens of millions of new revenue A dozen financial institutions already have all the legal and financial resources to do it,0,0,0,1,0

gtThis model allows a piece of data to be verified against the hash The blockchain entry also asserts ownership and a timestamp of that data However including the file hash in the research paper would achieve the same verification and ownership claim it would also be easier to use because it didnt rely on looking up a blockchain No storing the hash with the paper does not provide the same verification Who is hosting that research paper? Who controls the infrastructure used to transfer the paper from the host to the person reading it? If the same entity stores the paper and the hash they could modify the paper and generate a new hash Or if you control the infrastructure used to deliver the paperhash then you could modify both in transit You could have the researchers sign the paper with PGP Where are you getting their public key from to verify it? Is it being transmitted over the same infrastructure as the paper and hash? Even if the public key is delivered to you personally via Sneakernet you still need to trust that it hasnt been modified in transit Of course there was cryptography before Blockchain but at some point using traditional methods youre going to have to just trusthope that some entity isnt a bad actor Blockchain removes the need for trust and replaces it with the ability to verify gtThe LabTrace system does not address the fraud problem as the uploaded data could be fraudulent I dont think therell ever be a solution to shit goes in shit comes out But at least we could say for certain who is responsible for the shit,0,1,0,0,1
Dear webdevs of reddit I have been hearing all these web3 buzz and decided to go into it around 2022 I also found out about hacking smart contracts decentralized stuff and other stuffs But what is the main importance of web3 like what exactly is it making easier for us?

I would say that its still viable and has its own use cases Of course most of the chains are not quite the definition of decentralisation since fe quite a big amount of ETH validators are running on AWS and so and so But it solves one major problem centralised banking and proof of ownership amp origin Using NFTs you can create physical digital binding which might serve as a proof of ownership You also do not need banking systems to make transactions in crypto P2P exchange and onchain transaction which might be in some cases beneficial Nearinstant availability and anonymity Regarding anonymity and decentralisation Look at Montero for anonymity or Tornado smart contract should be still available Decentralisation is still an issue especially on PoS chains but I believe that crypto and web3 community is working on that Also all of it is quite tightly bound to IPFS which is another good thing but yeah I understand the scepticism since theres a lot of scams and people who do not care at all DeFi and NFT communities are still a thing Mainly its all useless and scammy projects but on the other hand there is quite a bit amount of artists who are making their living on this and many communities and companies who went fullblown web3 and are building on the principles even through this bear market,1,1,0,1,0
Web3 is a conundrum It was designed to protect the little guys but the big guys are the ones that stand the most to gain from it like DRM for the whole ass internet Google is actually trying to bring some of this theory to light but in a totally anticonsumer way that will eventually likely lead to the demise of the Chrome web browser,0,1,0,0,1

I think its starting to pick up more traction in the hobbiest community driven mostly by Thirdweb Its like Firebase for Smart Contracts Moves the complicated stuff behind the scenes and gives you a classic REST API Sounds centralised but you do deploy your own smart contracts you just use a service to do it for you You can take their smart contract templates and extend and deploy them yourself if you prefer Imo it does have usecases for authentication storage and authorization but it needs more adoption Cue someone who has never deployed a smart contract telling me im an idiot and its all a scam,0,1,0,1,0
From my understanding the decentralization itself will be enough of a paradigm shift if fully adopted Instead of trusting some company to keep track of what you own in a private database you trust math to keep track of what you own and its usually pretty hard to argue against math when something goes wrong Of course theres a tradeoff in how private some of these things should be but things like stock ownership or house ownership could definitely do without middle men and can afford to be public knowledge Without that killer app that gets mass adoption though itll definitely be an uphill battle before we reach a point where this becomes widespread I feel like that kind of resistance goes for a lot of things we take for granted now though so Id at least keep watching the space,1,0,0,1,0
Removing middlemen for real estate purchases isnt feasible Lets say you have an NFT that represents ownership of your home If someone steals that NFT do they now own your home?

Its alive but not in the US since were so slow with regulatory adoption But anything security related or tamper proof solutions are needed Lets say you have a customer that actually wants to verify 100 uniquely handmade and designed printed shirts from Bape with a artist collaboration but the people want to make sure they are getting legitimate products that are not tampered with for the quality the number of limited availability backed by the artists etc You would place this on a immutable layer with a decentralized platform Guaranteeing the authenticity is one proof of work from the security features But you wont find support for blockchain development much in the US as fast as other countries until we get senators to start laying ground rules so we can stop seeing scam companies take advantage of the tech like FTX or NFTs just for quick cash grabs Edif Ignore the downvotes Theres no real arguments against this and everything news wise mentioned in the post is actual progression regulatory wise for the US environment Everything is true People had the same skepticism with the dotcom boom too,0,1,0,1,1
How does block chain a digital tool prevent physical tampering? Couldnt you just put the shirts in packaging with a tamperproof seal?,0,0,0,1,1
There are multiple methods the most common one is using a RFID tag sowed into the shirt items presenting the link to the immutable certification of creation and additional details of the item from the beginning of production to shipping and sales of the item The idea is when creating the physical and digital connection to a immutable distributed ledger is that the company cannot spoof the numbers for the sake of sales and the customers cannot create a replica claiming to be the authentic item,1,0,0,1,0
Its a false sense of security at best I dont know if this plan involves recording purchases in the blocks chain If it doesnt RFID tags can be cloned so you could make a bunch of copies that would appear authentic Maybe if every authenticity check appeared in the ledger someone might get suspicious if one shirt had significantly more than others but by the time that became apparent there would be fakes out in the world Now lets say that ownership is recorded a person could buy the shirt create a copy transfer the RFID to the copy and keep the original In either case you quickly wind up in a situation where the digital record is not enough to guarantee authenticity,0,1,0,0,1
Yes the data transaction of the sales and the unique production certification of the product are both stored on the chain so that the data can stay immutable This solution is supposed to be preventing a centralized company from manipulating the database on the quantity from typical CRUD operations as data on chain cant be updated or edited The user has no need to do anything but to just purchase the physical product They can download the app to check and verify that the product is legitimate but thats it Create 100 items on chain where no centralized authority can tamper with the data customers can purchase with reassurance of legitimate purchases excluding and fake products nor scams improper business practices from a company,1,0,0,1,0
What exactly do you think these dastardly centralized institutions are going to do to their data? The question I always ask in this case is what happens if I lose access to the NFT that proves ownership? Say the NFT is stolen I still have the physical product but it will look like a fake because someone else holds the certificate of authority And if they hold the certificate then they could make their own fake with an RFID tag that points to the NFT,0,1,0,0,1
One way to deal with that just build a hybrid of centralization as a layer around the core of the items products of the business that needs the security layer decentralized aspect The outside layer can handled everything else for customer reassurances The point of the decentralization in the beginning aspect is the community wants to take ownership in their own realm of how the person manages their wealth assets so I wont be surprised if there are people who only want complete decentralized apps at a certain point too That basically means if they lose they lose it Like how they wanted too in the beginning to be in ownership of their own wealth management Be their own bank Those were mostly people who witness the 2008 and saw the government do nothing about the institutions that took money from peoples banks and 401ks I think its all nuanced until we get real professional ground work around the tech,0,0,0,1,1
So the only way your trustless solution works is to have a trusted authority available to verify the records are still correct?,0,1,0,0,1
gt Your trustless solution Not my solution nor would I say its trustless The only way itll become trustless maybe is when we move away from cloud services There was a trend in moving the app hosting to a new solution for decentralized hosting through multiple interconnected networks devices since hosting on cloud can be exponentially costly but still in the works Im only here to clarify what the general consensus is since we have no real standard Tbh though almost every single app is a hybrid of centralized development and decentralized aspects in the blockchain industry The decentralized aspects is just for the important core part of the business the company values and so does the customer Like say a credit service company Every transaction is valuable and should not ever be tampered with for the business and the customers end So primarily that would be the only portion that needs to be decentralized The rest like the typical customer service user experience support systems theyre all centralized developments that can built around the decentralized part I would say almost every app is like this in the blockchain world,0,1,0,1,0

Its not that Web3 is about incorporating blockchain and NFTs the idea is about the change in ownership and control Currently everything that you post on reddit twitter or YouTube is held and owned by those services Web3 flips that around where the users own and control their data content and the services get access to that data through requesting permission from the user The Bankless podcast guys have a simple way to describe this Web1 is readonly Web2 is readwrite Web3 is readwriteown If users own and control their content and services only are provided access to that data then you are going to see services be forced to find ways to pay the users who create the content We all are posting on Reddit for free and they earn millions in revenue would that relationship be the same if the content was never stored on Reddit servers and they only get access? Same with Twitter Think about Youtube they pay peanuts in ad revenue share to creators that have huuuuge followings and those relationships are also mediated through YouTube Do you think that would be the same if the content that creators made was controlled by the creators and users who watch the videos dont follow them on YouTube but instead follow the creators personal wallet address? Web 3 makes both content and relationships portable and the ownership remains under the control of the creators,1,0,0,1,0
gt held and owned The word youre looking for is hosted YouTube demands its legal rights in exchange for hosting The Web3 ideal covers conceptual ownership transfer but not any realization of value Its just unenforceable DRM with a big carbon footprint,0,1,0,0,1
It has nothing to do with DRM and like someone else down the thread you are confusing you are confusing the content of the data like copyright of text or video content with the actual data itself a record of a thing on the internet and the relationships it has to other things The current setup is like this Creator gt Youtube lt Users The Web3 idea is this Youtube Creator ltgt Users Creators give a Web3 service access to aggregate and display the data to users also handle ad sales display and revenue collection but ultimately the Web3 service connects users back to create a relationship directly with the creator instead of that relationship residing with YouTube,0,0,0,1,0
You still arent understanding You could have Web3 content with DRM and without thats orthogonal to the conversation Its not about the file itself its about the relationship between the record that represents the file and contains info about where the file can be found and the connections to that record Also its about where interactions like subscriptions follows for a creator or likes on a video live In a Web3 world if a better service comes along the content creator can decide to revoke YouTubes access to the file and authorize the new service to display that content and the people who subscribe to the content creator come along with that because that relationship isnt stored on Youtubes servers It would also allow you to do things like change the location of the actual file So maybe you get less ad money if YouTubes CDN stores your video but if you store the canonical copy on your own service then you get more of the ad split So a content creator that got really popular could move to a different service to host the actual file that is a better deal but the video would still be able to be found and watched via the YouTube site because all it is doing is looking at the record This is how it currently works btw Youtube the site doesnt host your video The actual file is stored on Googles CDN and the Youtube interface just knows where to find the file Right now you dont have a choice though You upload to YouTube they control where things are stored how users follow you etc,0,1,0,1,0
gt In a Web3 world if a better service comes along the content creator can decide to revoke YouTubes access to the file and authorize the new service to display that content and the people who subscribe to the content creator come along with that because that relationship isnt stored on Youtubes servers No you cant You can write the revocation on the blockchain and youtube can just ignore what it says All this blockchain business requires various parties to look at your particular blockchain and make the intentional choice to obey it It can even be selectively ignored Nothing stops Youtube from deciding We obey this particular blockchain except for these particular records that we dont care about,0,1,0,0,1

Who hosts the billions of gigs of videos in a web3 post YouTube world? How does the average Joe get his video on the web for a few dozen people he knows to watch it?,0,0,0,1,1
I think I see where you are getting snagged In a web3 world all those videos would likely still be all hosted by Google YouTube because they have a giant CDN that is optimized for that The important difference is who controls the references on where to find things and the relationships that other people have to the content The content itself meaning for video media files doesnt matter Right now everything is mediated through YouTube first and they own all of that So for a creator they Go to YouTube Create an account Upload a video Add description info Get likes follows Get comments And for a user Im only going to be talking about a user who interacts with content not a casual viewer they Go to YouTube Create an account Watch a video Like the video and follow the creator Leave a comment In both cases YouTube owns everything Ive been putting it in quotes because Im not talking about the content but the relationships The accounts are made with YouTube The new video object lives in YouTubes database The description info likes follows and comments tied to that object also all live and exist only in YouTubes system In a Web3 world things are different For a creator they Create a wallet I hate this term and assume it will go away as it is too closely tied to money when unreality crypto wallets are all just unique identifiers that can contain other unique identifiers Its really just an account Sign into Web3 Youtube or whatever by authorizing the site to access the wallet Use some video hosting could be YouTube could be something else to upload a video and the upload and location of the file is written to the wallet as an object that the wallet owns Descriptive info is added and this too is written to the wallet and associated with the video object For users they Create a wallet Sign into Web3 Youtube or whatever by authorizing the site to access the wallet Watch a video the history is recorded to their wallet with a link to the creators video object Like the video this gets recorded to their wallet and also theres a reference made on the video object Follow the creator this is recorded to the users wallet as a link to the creators wallet Leave a comment this too is recorded and linked to the video object None of those relationships are owned by YouTube The creator might authorize the video to be displayed on Youtube and with it comes all the other information Web3 Youtube might show some of that info or all of it Maybe comments dont show unless a user also signs into the service and authorizes comments theyve left on videos to be displayed regardless of where it happened and the actual content of the comment stays on the users wallet and the video object just knows that there is a link there that is a comment type object and if the user and creator allow it to be public then it shows if not then it doesnt The idea isnt to change hosting its to give content creators the control of the pointer that references where the content can be found and along with that comes other data like the creators audience A creator posting a new video wouldnt send an alert out through YouTube but rather the alert would go to the wallet of the user who followed the creator so it wouldnt matter where new content was posted If they click the link theyd go to where that new content is So if YouTube offers the best deal then it would make sense to authorize YouTube to host and show the video If for some reason the creator got a better deal elsewhere they could switch platforms and everyone who liked the video or followed the creator could see the history of the things they watched in some near future UI that looks at their wallet and shows a history of interactions The idea is that everything the content and everything around it is portable,0,1,0,1,0
One way to think about it is Up until now the structure of Internet services is the way that it is because storing all of the data to run a service is difficult expensive at scale and if you have millions of users regularly using the service the scale gets really really big and doing things like querying giant databases to build all the data needed to show content show likes etc is really complicated vs In the web 3 concepts the database for services is the entire system of blockchain networks and any relevant data or relationships for a given user or piece of content gets prepulled together by the users wallet or by the content creators wallet The service doesnt need to deal with massive databases all that information is already aggregated A user signs in and the service just asks their wallet for the users history on the site They click to watch video and the service asks the creators wallet for the location of the media and the history of interactions Since all the interactions end up writing to the respective wallets at the time of interaction those wallets contain all the up to date data that can be requested by a given service Of course the only caveat here is that for this to be the real future we need near zero cost transactions provided by something like rollups on Ethereum,1,0,0,1,0
Web 30 could be amazing but theres not really many people doing much beyond investment schemes with it right now We could build a decentralized infrastructure that allows content creators to both get paid for their work and make distribution and sharing of that hassle free Theres no money in that though for investors so everyone with any resources is just pushing bullshit coins and nft marketplaces Same old Web 20 thinking with some fancy new toys Too bad were just going to waste all the potential,1,1,1,0,0
The issue is that nominally decentralized permissionless blockchain systems that currently dominate the space require processing power to execute their evolution This processing power is expensive because it is well literal power electricity used to execute computation And so to incentivize a distributed pool of people to spend their electricity on keeping your blockchain working you need to promise them something in return Since theres no central authority everyone has decided that the simplest solution is a token representing the value of the chain Theres no way to remove the finance piece from the current model It has to be financialized if people dont buy into the speculative investment idea that tokens for a given chain will be worth more in the future they wont spend their electricity now to keep the system operating Fundamentally because theres no organizing body with the authority to manage resources and finances the system must power itself with hype Decentralized infrastructure is exciting but the current path people claim will take us there permissionless decentralized blockchains cannot escape the incentives that inevitably transform them into speculative assets that get used in financial schemes Its pretty dense but this is well worth a read ,0,1,0,0,1
i think groups like Loopring and ImmutableX have been solving the energy issue or so claims have been made I see web3 as focusing on the decentralized aspect of the network where we are not dependent on amazon to host a massive chunk of the internet and instead that content and functionality is provided in a more P2Plike model I could be way off base but thats my take on it,1,0,0,1,0
Even if you solve the energy issue you cant solve the financialization issue You cant remove the financial piece without removing the fuel that quite literally powers the continued existence and updating of the chain For a decentralized pool of people to maintain the operating hardware that keeps a chain active they either need to pay for electricity or pay for infrastructure that generates electricity etc etc it doesnt matter exactly the point is that somewhere down the line electricity isnt free out of the goodness of their heart or they need to believe that the monetary rewards for doing so will continue to increase And it has to be expensive to contribute to maintaining a chain because if its cheap then sybil attacks become trivial The only way for the value of the tokens that are distributed as rewards to increase is for them to become more in demand by people who want to exchange fiat currency for the token and so the correct move is always to do whatever it takes to drive up demand of the token The only way decentralization works without this set of incentives that we are seeing in real time encourage excesses of bad scammy behavior is if you excise the entire token system meaning you either need to find different rewards for people contributing resources to maintaining the chain or more likely you need to ditch the chain as your technology of choice I dont tend to make predictions about the future but if I did I would say that a successfully decentralized future looks a lot more like BitTorrent and a lot less like Etherium,0,1,0,0,1

Its also that increasingly the applications that make data stored on a Blockchain meaningful and not just a bunch of bits are coming to rely on third party services as well there was that service for managing NFTs that was itself just using the OpenSea API meaning that if OpenSea changed how it treated a token the subsequent service provider does as well The idea of Web 30 decentralization is butting up against the social reality that services are much easier to provide if they piggyback off of other third party services The reason Web 20 was invented was because people wanted to do more than just broadly speaking host and display text and image content on noninteractive pages Currently Web 30 hasnt demonstrated that it can support complex services purely on the chain smart contracts have too little memory and their inability to be patched creates major software development headaches So everyone is just reinventing platforms,0,1,0,0,1
Youve got it a little wrong Web3 decentralization isnt about the decentralization of services applications but about ownership of data Right now any time you use an internet service your data is stored and owned in a centralized way for that specific service Web3 is about inverting that so that the users own their data and web3 services will access what the users bring to the service allow the service to use,1,0,0,1,0

Youtube wants to guarantee videos played on their site are delivered consistently to their end users This means ensuring that theres no interruption to video playback with errors or buffering Theres no way to guarantee this with random third party CDNs and ultimately if your video doesnt play youre going to bitch at Youtube not the creator or the CDN No video streaming service will want to deal with this and a streaming service delivering crappy video playback is going to lose users Oh yeah search engines exist They can already search multiple video streaming sites So yeah youre literally handwaving away all the problems inherent to what it is youre proposing And youre illustrating my point Theres a reason why Web 3 hasnt revolutionized the world despite it being a buzzword for so many years Because its literally a solution in search for a problem Youre proposing building a solution that is worse than Youtube for marginal at best benefit for everyone involved And heres the thing literally everything you just described is solvable with current services and technology Why do we need web 3 to achieve it?,0,1,1,0,0
So youre saying We dont need an identity wallet Because we are the wallet That kinda makes sense But I dont wanna remember so many passwords and usernames and I dont wanna have to try to find creators I like on new platforms! Its kind of interesting because this way of thinking would be crazy if you were walking about typing in a word document or having a phonebook on your phone instead of writing it down in a little blackbook in order to remember it I think this kind of idea about content is stupid though Theres soooo much out there all fighting for our time and attention which is very finite We cant make time for even a fraction of whats out there I dont think it would be that valuable to have all your content follow you regardless of platform Do they think if this were implemented they would grow their platform way faster way larger?

The first thing to note is that all of these are marketing terms and not the name of any underlying technology or standard The web still fundamentally runs on protocols like TCPIP HTTP 123 TLS etc While the web traditionally used to primarily be a content delivery mechanism the term Web 20 was coined when a lot of more interactive websites started coming about which focused on userdriven content creation think social media blogs wikis The problem with coming up with a single definition of Web3 is that everyone has their own idea of what it should mean It generally refers to anything related to blockchain and decentralization So cryptocurrencies decentralized finance NFTs DAOs peertopeer storage etc,0,1,0,1,0

This is decentralization Well Web 30 at least according to the hype aims to take web 20 and decentralize it using technology built on the same ideas that torrents are built on There are several benefits to this around socializing power dynamics that I am not going to get into The problem though is that at least right now what web 30 is is a LOT closer to an empty marketing term for blockchain bros to spout nonsense than what it wants to be,0,1,1,1,0

Im a software engineer who has built a few applications with blockchain technologies nothing here is that easily digestible and impostor syndrome is firing off everywhere so Ill take a stab lol For a 5 year old Think of how things currently work as going to a classmates birthday party as a kid this is web20 You get dropped off at the house and the parents or hosts of the party let you in You look around and see a bunch of other kids eating snacks and doing a bunch of activities Maybe you want to grab a snack or start working on a craft maybe talk to some other kids No matter what you want to do at that party the hosts will try to provide you with everything you need Your classmates parents are paying for everything they planned all the activities and make sure everything goes smoothly Even though the hosts are handling everything you can still go to the washroom or eat without their help and at the end of the day you are more or less choosing what you want to do with whats there but you can leave whenever you want your mom will pick you up Web3 is more like inviting your friend over after school You have your own stuff now your own room games and activities More importantly you dont have to go through your parents for every little thing You can get food or drinks yourself you might have to pay for pizza if you want that though You can choose what you want to show or do with your friend The only thing your parents provided is the house which kinda makes them the host but they dont have to handle everything So is one better than the other? Not necessarily sure youll have more freedom with web3 but youre just a kid so things can get out of hand really fast Maybe you and your friend get into an argument over what youre doing or maybe you bought too much pizza The one thing for sure is that youre probably not cleaning up after yourselves and the house is total mess Tldr Web2 is more controlled but clean and fairly consistent you have more freedom with web3 but its kinda a mess To bring it down a level of abstraction Web2 is a focus on connecting peers together through a third party Web3 is a focus on peers connecting directly Btw web2 and web3 are just big umbrella buzz words for current and future web technologies Will web3 ever become the standard?

Web3 Its the next iteration of the internet Were still in Web2 but Web3 is being built now Decentralized in concept to take on the Big Tech giants its built on blockchain to sideskirt the centralized platforms that dominated Web2 The goal to relinquish control from Big Tech and put the power into the hands of creators,1,0,0,1,0
Real question I assume web3 relies on storing website assets html js images data and diffs in a blockchain ledger When a client wants to go to a website how do they get the data? Do they have to download the entire web3 internet resolve a domain to a specific point in the ledger then calculate diffs to get a working website?,0,1,0,1,0
Few things are actually stored on the blockchain ledger Its way too expensive to do that The data is instead stored offchain like in a central server or ipfs For example the actual images of NFTs arent stored on the blockchain Instead only a URL pointing to the image is stored Theres no guarantees that the URL will keep working forever Many NFTs are actually pointing to 404 error pages because the URL is already dead,0,1,0,0,1

You can include a hash with the NFT but from what I understand its not always done Anyways a hash alone isnt enough to prove the authenticity of an image I can make a copy of your NFT Change a single pixel so a new hash is generated and then make an NFT of it According to the blockchain my NFT is as authentic your NFT even if they both live on the same chain,0,1,0,0,1

Actually I think the original idea of web 30 has been twisted beyond recognition It was never about DeFi clearly not even about financial stuff Its always been about decentralized infrastructure Stuff like Akash where you can deploy containers securely without a central entity having the power to decide they dont want to offer you their services Decentralized DNS so that you cant get randomly shafted by a centralized registrar Decentralized file storagedatabases user management services etc In general censorshipresistant infrastructure so your service cant get shut down by anyone,0,1,0,1,0
How is it MLM though? The concept doesnt cost anything? You can critique it for a lot of other things but I dont see how it amounts to MLM Edit if you just say web3cryptocurrencies nfts etc then I see where you may come from but crypto market speculation isnt really what the idea of web3 is about The broader philosophy beyond crypto and more importantly is about decentralization and reduced dependence on monoliths like Facebook and Google Web3 in this sense can happen the technology exists but almost certainly wont happen in my opinion since I dont see any mechanism for getting people en masse to start using web3 services rather than traditional ones which while more exploitative against people are also more reliable and have the benefit of huge network effects by now,0,1,0,1,0
Eh thats overselling iti think The basic idea im not defending it just describing it as best I can is that a did is just a uri that correllates an identity with a document no crypto necessary But optional In the web 5 plan they do use some elaborate bitcoin based nftlike identifiers but thats it Theres a whole business about decentralized data stores and relay nodes but that shit aint going nowhere,0,1,0,0,0

gtDecentralized web The funny thing is about the decentralized web idea for web 30 it isnt user friendly The way it is suppose to work is that each time a user visits some web 30 content they download that content from other people who have visited that content before Very much like a torrent but after you visit that content the user now becomes a seeder or a CDN for that content The downside with is two fold First is that a lot of countries have ISPs that have bandwidth caps That means the customer has a total bandwidth usage limit for each month If they go over that limit they could face bandwidth throttling higher costs for each bit of data over the limit etc And that is a big huge issue as a user if there is no way for as a user to say hey Im not going to act like a CDN people could be seeing unexpected high ISP bills or even their internet getting throttled or even cut off Not to mention just acting like the CDN could use up someones the current bandwidth speed thus slowing down their connection if they are actively using it Sure it could be done where the CDN only sends data if the connection isnt actively being used But that would still require a connection to be opened and a check done etc Second the user would have a public record of them visiting said site or how else would they be able to act like a CDN for that content Live in a country with a dictatorship they could see who is visiting content that they dont approve of So no decentralization in web 30 gtCryptography So what about cryptography honestly there wouldnt be much of a change between how cryptography works now with the web and with web 30 Unless you have it were each connection a user does is with the users private key as part of the secret sure you could do that but that is a bit less secure than the current way where essentially each connection the private key is randomly generated for the user and the server they are connecting to gtZero Trust systems Already exist in web 20 A lot of systems have it set up that authentication is done constantly but a lot of it is done in the background using tokens and what not gtAnonymity Not really I have heard that web 30 might come with the user controlling their data through a data wallet or something Which in that case you could just switch out which data wallet is given to a website But the issue with that two fold First is what is to stop a website from accessing the data wallet and saving the data on it on their own servers? And to top it off a lot of major tech companies do have tools to associate existing data to a person even if that person has wiped their data on their end and hasnt logged into the tech companies system to identify themselves to an existing id A lot of that is done via some sort of fingerprinting system You would have to use something like Tor to have some what of some Anonymity but if you have it for every user acting like a node in the Tor network you come into some of the issues I mentioned in decentralization section namely bandwidth issues And Tor itself isnt exactly safe itself As researchers have been able to use a beefy computer to identify some people using Tor or at least where some of the connections are coming from or going to in the past gtFreedom of information See the decentralization section To me it seems like Web 30 from what has been talked about doesnt solve issues but creates more,0,1,1,0,1
Dont forget that people are relying on a public immutable ledger for privacy Also users might be able to put in a decent amount of work to remain anonymous when dealing with crypto eg using a sketchy ass exchange that doesnt do KYC but good luck cashing out into real money and still staying unknown,0,1,0,0,1
The point is that they cant prevent it from happening or trace it to actual people unless they know your ID on the blockchain Youre goofy if you think authoritarian governments dont already have access to financial transactions Hell even the US government has access to that To be clear I dont think Web 30 is going to look the way that crypto bros think it will its impossible to predict that kind of thing I just wanted to point out that you have some fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain technology and government access to transaction records,0,1,0,0,1
gtits impossible to predict that kind of thing More people need to hang onto this From what I can see there is very little nuance being discussed Those on either side talk in extremes and conclusions Its either a ponzi or a replacement for a global centralised financial system No discussion no curiosity no research And developers who go at blockchain without understanding what they are talking about should be ashamed Its like talking about NoSQL with authority without having ever used a NoSQL database Absurd amount of ignorance and overreaction From a tech perspective I see this current phase as similar to original NoSQL drama but dialled up to 11 Blockchain is just a technology I dont see why people lose their minds when talking about it Age old story in tech I suppose we do it with languages and frameworks all the time,0,1,0,1,0
Unfortunately the block chain only assists in those problems as long as companies and governments dont adopt it Block chains are public ledgers they act similarly to a public registry a government could use them to control peoples access to services and track their usage to a greater degree than they can currently The current systems of proof of work and proof of stake also lead to control being correlated to wealth and so in the long run these systems will be dominated by the already powerful Any freedom it provides currently is an illusion that comes purely from the tech being new,0,1,0,0,1

Absolutely nothing about how cryptocurrenciesNFTs work requires that it work the way you imagine The NFT is at best no more than a receipt If a DRM server decides it cant be resold then it can simply blacklist the token if the wallet address changes Or they could arrange it so that they get a big cut of the transaction if you ever resell it Nothing about how this works requires that it be consumerfriendly and its unclear why any existing platform would agree to implement such a system it doesnt benefit either the platform or the developer And more than that this isnt much of a real problem in the first place Most of the major issues with game pricing these days has little to do with upfront costs its microtransactions and upfront costs are if anything lower than ever you never saw widespread deeply discounted sales with physical copies like you see with digital storefronts for example and even full price most games are still 2060 about the same as it was 20 years ago which with inflation means theyre quite a bit cheaper,0,1,0,0,1

Honestly one of the biggest upsides to crypto is as an open source financial transaction framework Try looking for books or tutorials on how to program a till and payment gateway to take credit cards all you get for search results telling you to use some proprietary software suite by IBM in the 80s Conversely to create a payment provider system instead of a payment gateway processor then you need to request access to an API of an industry giant like Visa Mastercard etc Crypto though?

I work in fintech doing exactly this it sounds like you dont have a good overview of the fintech space and are underestimating both the technical and legal implications by several orders of magnitude Crypto transactions are simple not because its better but because its so barebones they fulfill barely even the smallest fraction of what payment processors do If you try to go anywhere beyond that you face the same problems as the rest of the payment industry as well as the problems of using crypto transactions,0,1,0,0,1

Blockchain is a data structure its not a magical thing And if Im not wrong the first Blockchain was developed by a bank in 1991 Its just a way to store data that preserves the integrity of it If the government create a Blockchain it wont have any impact on other Blockchains they arent connected in anyway And well I dont think you know PoW because the ONLY way to centralize it is by taking control of 100 of the millions of computers connected to a PoW network ate the same time And then theyd have to keep controlling every single computer and electronic device in the world to make sure it doesnt connect to a PoW network again Its absolutely impossible And if it was possible theyd already do that to the Onion network which isnt a Blockchain but is decentralized I only agree with you when it comes to PoS PoS is centralized and easy to take control of since the government just have to control one person or a small group of people Why do you think governments around the world are forcing cryptos to switch to PoS? Because they cant handle PoW its literally impossible this is why its called a zero trust system And this is the problem most cryptos have everybody knows who made them who controls it and who they have to kidnap to take control over the network Its very easy to destroy Ethereum all the government have to do to achieve this is arrest Vitalik or kill him Anything that happens to him will destroy the network because theyre not a zero trust system all Ethereum users have to trust Vitaliks decisions Bitcoin Monero and other cryptos developed by volunteers and that theres no representative person cant be seized Nobody knows who is Satoshi Nakamoto so theres no one to arrestkill And even if the government say I know who is Satoshi and I killed him nobody would believe because theres absolutely no way they can prove it Its a zero trust system nobody have to trust anything but the code which is completely open source so everybody can read it test it play with it and be sure that it can be trusted Bitcoin has an emblematic phrase Dont trust verify So I recommend you read a little bit more about how Blockchain works because its very interesting Its the only notrust system we have NFTs Metaverse and all these crap doesnt mean anything for Blockchain they are only experimental stuff yet built on a very solid system called Blockchain which already has proven to be reliable,0,1,0,1,0

I really hope you are joking This statement shows no understanding of how a blockchain works at all The entire point of it is that its decentralized It is not stored in a data center People all over the world have it the entire chain stored on their computer and that computer is whats called a node Typically there is no limit to the quantity of nodes People with nodes then have to use a large amount of computing power to mine which is when they verify transactions before they are added to the chain Someone would have to have 51 of the computing power on a blockchain in order to add fraudulent blocks or alter existing blocks But I agree with your last point Using a centralized service to manage your crypto is stupid and completely defeats the point of using a decentralized currency But decentralization does work on practice thats what Bitcoin showed us The issue is when people give control of their crypto wallets to a third party If you dont do that though your cryptocurrency is safe so long as you dont give anyone your private key,0,1,1,1,0

When web 20 was coined in the early 2000s we already had a bunch of successful technologies and companies that we could point to Blogging podcasting Wikipedia and Reddit were all examples of it Web 20 was a shorthand for labeling similar new things we already used It wasnt just a marketing term used to build up hype even if some companies started using it in advertising So far web3 seems to consist of avatars on Twitter avatars on Reddit and a lot of stuff we can just lump into things that trade tokens The last category seems to be what its really about Lets be generous and say theres nothing wrong with companiesorganizations that exist just to trade tokens Even then its pretty obviously ridiculous to call that the future of the internet At best its a niche hobby for nerds We keep seeing cryptoevangelists claim that a web3 version of Twitter would be superior because you couldnt censor it or shut it down and that a web3 version of Wikipedia would be superior because the facts would be verifiable on the blockchain whatever that means and so on Yet a year later those same people are still posting on Twitter and still reading Wikipedia In fact in the latest Twitter exodus people did flock to a decentralized social network Mastodon It is conspicuously not a web3 or blockchain service So am I missing something?

Nothing about how the tech works actually incentivizes decentralization quite the opposite PoS is explicitly plutocratic and incentives the hoardingpooling of tokenscoinsetc for greater rewards and control The nature of how the chain works is so inflexible in the face of even basic real world complexity that building centralized abstractions is practically a requirement otherwise you have no way to deal with fraud theft mistakes and other issues The chain can only be authoritative in a trustless fashion for things that are onchain but almost everything youd actually care about is offchain including anything that touches the real world as well as a way to link addresses with real world identities So now you need trusted oracles and external authority anyways which will naturally trend towards centralization for the same reasons the existing web did Etc etc As for monetization Because monetizing everything at the microlevel is exhausting from a user perspective and creates perverse incentives Its the same reason players dont like microtransactions in games it inventives developers to build paytowin mechanics that undermine actual entertainment value,0,1,0,0,1

Yeah! Im working on a music tech company focused on derivative works remixes covers etc Its a very tricky part of the music industry because music rights holders dont want tons and tons of different versions of their songs flooding music platforms and watering down the value of their originals That said people love making remixes and theyre all over social media So the plan was to allow people to make remixes of licensed music legally using our software and they could only share their remixes as an NFT This allows them to share on platforms like Instagram and whatnot without violating any copyright laws and by using NFTs there was a limit on how many copies can be in circulation which rights holders loved So the NFTs themselves arent some sort of investment vehicle more of a copyright monitoring system Users also would have had to own NFTs of the original songs in order to make the remixes in the first place so again artists could limit the number of remixes created and transparently monitor who has copyright permission to make those remixes So our core mission is to make remixes accessible and legal for anybody to make and NFTs were an avenue for us to do that Now that Apple released those policies we took a very hard pivot and arent doing anything web3 related but now some of the labels were negotiating with are hesitant out of concern that well just be creating more copyright issues for them to monitor and enforce Luckily we have a really solid new plan though its a bit more complicated and involves several more middlemen in order to work Edit worth mentioning our NFT version which isnt happening anymore didnt involve its own cryptocurrency had no tokenomics and was priced in USD Was just trying to leverage smart contract tech,1,0,1,1,1

I think people forget that Web2 was supposed to be decentralized too see this great Tom Scott video video Originally the whole idea with Web2 was that services from different providers could share data with each other and everything would be open The problem is that market forces push towards monopolies Instead of making their own tools to communicate with other services people just started using existing platforms and those platforms became increasingly locked down as they became the tech giants we have today The only reason Web3 feels subversive is that the giants havent colonized it yet If it ever does take off Google and Facebook will build the AWS of crypto and it wont matter if their data is technically stored across many peoples computers they will still forge a monopoly like we are already seeing with 0pen Sea Coinbase Metamask etc because thats what markets do,0,1,0,0,1

PoW PoS or anything else Doing same work multiple times one time in multiple nodes just seems inefficient Not just validation part but also storing same data in thousands of nodes or doing db insert doing some calculations when adding new blocks to blockchain thats still a work thats done multiple times But its needed for decentralization? Yeah thats what we as a tech community look to solve Theres some decentralized messaging platforms that does respect privacy of each node by not downloading the whole data not having to do the same operations multiple times while being trustworthy for example and yet its not part of web3 unfortunately An example would be some protocol used by mastodon as mentioned by someone else on this thread,0,1,0,1,0
gt Doing same work multiple times one time in multiple nodes just seems inefficient Well thats just cryptography And decentralization If you download a file over a secure protocol it gets encrypted and decrypted and hashed and hashed again all useless work that an attacker cant do You join a Matrix room and your homeserver processes all the messages in the room to keep track of the room state just like the homeservers of everyone else in the room,0,1,1,0,0

Even level 2 networks need to eventually go back to the root chain? While I find it unlikely that BTC will adapt PoS I assume BTC will be used less frequently requiring less miners in order to keep the network secure Personally I find the idea of blockchain to not scale that well write locks are difficult in trusted environments how would it be any easier in untrusted environments? and other technologies like directed acyclic graphs will eventually take over the ecosystem,0,1,0,1,0

Blockchains arent meant to be some utopia and if anyone is claiming that then they are wrong They are better than the systems we have now A trustless web infrastructure is the way forward Payments should be peer to peer without a trusted 3rd party intervening Websites should be able to be hosted by the people without a companyservice able to pull the plug There will be pitfalls but you dont just stop innovation because of it Just like airplanes Im sure someone more clever than I can come up with a mechanism to make Web3 safer If you want to trade decentralization for monitoring illicit material then fine But dont complain when they inevitably overstep their boundaries and infringe on your rights Facebook sells all your data Robinhood stifles free trade AWS goes down and takes half the web with it Centralization has got to go,1,1,0,0,1
My response isnt shit happens its dont kill the whole technology while its still having kinks worked out The benefits outweigh the downside Blockchains can be forked If the community of minersstakers all decide that they want to fork off the chain that contains illicit material then they can The old chain will cease to exist if no one is mining on it anymore I am all for scams being stopped They delegitimize the blockchain space But making blockchain illegal is not the answer,1,1,0,0,1
Not really Its the same thing as buying some Bitcoin except a picture is tied to it No single Bitcoin is worth more than another Bitcoin the same is not true for NFTs where these tokens are trading for different values because theyre all different Whether or not you get scammed on one sale is irrelevant to the point that this is a pretty neat technology that takes an advance made by Bitcoin and extends it to create more diversity in the market where theres no set single type of money like say a 1 5 20 bill etc but instead an infinite number of codebills that can represent different values based on whatever the communities confidence is in that codebill on the market Why should I invest my savings in a bill that has Benjamin Franklin on it? Because the global community has confidence in that type of bill Why should I invest my savings in a monkey token?

Look at the first comment I responded to He clearly thinks it should be made illegal That was what im responding to What do you mean your transaction history? It can part of the blockchain history without it having any negative effect on you If its part of your transaction history then good luck Not implying a fork is desirable but it is a possible solution to the problem And what incentivizes minersstakers is income They go where the fees can be collected If the users deem the illicit chain to be bad then minersstakers have no incentive to keep that chain alive thus the forked chain continues on Regarding the payment discrepancy most blockchains will have a layer 2 These layer 2s will push batch transactions to the protocol layer like Ethereum So your employer would most likely be operating on an entirely different Layer 2 chain than something illicit material was being operated on Yes all data would get published to Ethereum at the end of the day,0,1,0,1,0

My understanding is that although it does not offer perfect security its still the best option for privacy especially if the website is on TOR itself rather than a clearnet site being accessed through an exit node And anyway even without enhanced privacy its still an example of a way for a website to remain accessible without the use of DNS and an open source means of using a decentralized network Not sure what you mean by the problem of gatekeeping but downloading the browser is pretty simple,0,1,0,1,0
In theory they could be and in some countries they probably are But in practice I dont see a lot of gatekeeping going on Encryption is not prohibited there are a variety of ways to prevent your ISP from seeing your traffic and there is also reasonable availability of public wifi that you can access without ID As long as that is how things work decentralized websites and currencies are just as useful as they would be if accessed from a meshnet which ironically is much more locked down the FCC and similar government bodies tightly control the actually practically useful radio spectrums The groundwork to block a particular kind of use or particular individuals or groups is just not there,0,1,0,1,0
But in that case nobody is blocking access to a decentralized service they are preventing the efficient hosting of centralized websites and use of existing centralized websites Blocking is not happening on the ISP level The issue would not be addressed in any way by meshnets but possibly could be addressed by use of decentralized websites and protocols So I dont think this contributes to your argument that decentralized websites and currencies are useless without more ways to get online without an ISP The groundwork Im talking about is more along the lines of China style authoritarian regulation of the web Things like banning encrypted traffic except from authorized backdoored sources banning TOR and non authorized VPN use requiring an account associated with a persons state ID for any connection to the internet no more open public wifi that kind of groundwork without which any attempt to control particular uses or users at the ISP level is doomed to fail,0,1,0,0,1

Dont let them fool you with smokes and mirrors Slapping a username on a wallet doesnt solve the underlying issues Usernames URLs and the like are still very prone to user errors and scams It really only solves the long incomprehensible string of letters and numbers Banks let you shortcut transactions as well and the reason why they are safe is not because you have a plastic card to blip instead of having to punch in a bunch of numbers but because the banks have reasons to prevent user error and scams Without a central authority to provide a safety net the utility of credit cards would come with many more risks So ultimately being reliant on platforms to provide a better user experience and safety net will take away the decentralized aspect This is important because its been the part that theyve been trying to pitch If we just end up reliant on a different set of platforms than before what well have is just the same thing we have now but with a slight shift in who the centralized actors are,0,1,0,0,1

I think thats the interesting question right? I dont think any of us would have predicted 99 of the problems the Internet has helped solve or at least made better Like in 1983 did anyone seriously ask what the Internet was trying to solve and expect an answer that was within the realms of what we know today? Was it connectivity for the sake of connectivity? I mean we already had telephone right? The only thing we can analyze are the features of Web3 that make it somewhat novel or a departure from Web2 I think those things are predominantly open source systems vs closed privately owned systems digital native payment systems via crypto currencies programmable money vs payments powered by existing banking infrastructure decentralized proof of identity and ownership vs federated identity and ownership In a nutshell Web3 is Web2 but with the super powers of cryptography and a culture of open source What problems can that solve?

Computing tends to cycle between centralised technologies and decentralised technologies We started with centralised computing via big single mainframes with dumb terminal inputs in the 60s then we progressed to personal singleuser computers in the 90s and people hosting their own websites on their own servers or servers they rented then we bounced to the corporate Internet age where most applications people use today are thin clients for social media silos like Facebook twitter insta or big centralised services like netflix YouTube tiktok and now we are starting to see people going back the other way again towards decentralised applications which in this context involve block chain Decentralised tech definitely doesnt need to be block chain Torrenting is an example of non block chain p2p and there are movements of people running their own federated and distributed social media services like Mastodon which is a federated twitter alternative,0,1,0,1,0
Not necessarily true regarding privacy there are certainly ways to maintain confidentiality private and public ledgers will be able to interoperate along with legacy systems Also not necessarily true regarding blockchain Bitcoin is archaic and low hanging fruit tbf yet its true that the blockchain structure is fundamentally flawed for most of the purposes its proponents envision and all attempts so far are met with a compromise in some aspect of what is required Contrast this with other Distributed Ledger Technologies such as a Hashgraph and you see much more than just absolute finality in 27 seconds aBFT security the theoretical gold standard of security for any distributed system verified by Carnegie Mellon as well as the capacity to scale sufficiently to provide their highly demanded infrastructure in every single industry and digital market In terms of energy consumption Bitcoin 360393 00 3691407 00 kilowatt hours per transaction Visa 0003 58 kWhtx Hedera Hashgraph 0000 02 0000 04 kWhtx Source UCL As a bonus the inherent efficiency of the Hashgraph consensus algorithm also allows fixed fees Currently to send someone any amount of money anywhere in the world with absolute finality within 27 seconds it would cost you exactly 00001 USD same for immutable consensus in a fair public ledger DLT goes a lot further than money This has been demonstrated in a proof of concept created in collaboration between Standard Bank and Shinhan Bank for cross border remittance using digital currency concluded last year and regarded as an absolute success by all parties Like these two banks Australian national debit provider eftpos is a legal member of the Hedera LLC they fully intend to leverage this technology as a fundamental part of their network infrastructure Just the tip,0,1,0,1,0
Thanks for that info Thats a good bit of additional context Im glad to see some methods becoming a lot lower and more predictable in transaction cost both in and in energy My main criticism of this comparison Visa to Hedera or any other blockchain approach is that I dont believe its counting classes of energy consumption Specifically the Visa network is a lot of physical infrastructure to support transactions in a lot of different venues If blockchain transactions became the norm that hardware wouldnt go away People still need the ability to transfer money in realtime in a specific place where they are colocated with the seller and the goods potentially anywhere on Earth That infrastructure will still exist even if its mostly in the form of two cell phones in the same place they will still be using energy and resources Currently the cost of maintaining pointofsale infrastructure is currently being counted in the Visa network totals but not in the algorithm totals Another potential source of discrepancy is that the paper you link to did calculations based on theoretical systems and while they talk a bit about base load in system configurations a lot of financial transaction networks invest a significant amount of resources including idle power to support some minimum number of transactions per second even when far fewer transactions are currently happening Provisioning for unpredictable peaks can be costly and thats not adequately covered in this paper In some kind of oneworld currency based on Hiderea that overprovisioning would be minimized but I suspect the reality of a blockchainbased global economy would involve a lot of smaller networks that all need their own overprovisioning for various reasons at various times Thats a lot of waste that exists in the current system and wouldnt be eliminated by blockchain but isnt accounted for in that paper And that is the fundamental issue I have blockchain adds energy costs to transactions but doesnt eliminate any I have yet to see a compelling argument for what sources of energy use in the current financial industry would be eliminated by switching to blockchain Globally there are something like a billion traceable transactions happening per day If even something as efficient as Hidera were used to cover them all I believe that would be adding not replacing that small transaction cost which adds up to something on the order of tens of megawatthours per day if used for every transaction If Web 30 enthusiasts get their way the number of transactions on the blockchain would likely be one or two orders of magnitude larger than even that to cover all the other types of things people would be doing with those exchanges Thats a lot of power spent doing cryptography that isnt necessary for a simpler approach to transactions,0,1,0,0,1
I appreciate the importance of your concerns and the fact youve researched them well I will add just a small caveat that Hedera themselves have committed to being and remaining carbon negative and have described the offsets needed to achieve neutrality alone as being fairly small It really is bad form for me to be promoting a particular project in this sort of discussion its worth noting that the underlying open source Hashgraph algorithm has definite technical advantages that make it measurably about as efficient as it gets to propagate data let alone all the other things that can be done on top for virtually no extra cost with math proofs from Carnegie Mellon and the like to back it up The decentralized free flowing nature of data also makes cloud storage and other types of server farms less important it will mostly be using existing computers and adding little additional workload and often replacing other more intensive sources I believe the square cube law applies here? I must admit my technical knowledge is lacking Ive learnt a lot and am actively educating myself on the development side of things nonetheless its often a good idea to defer to the experts while understanding they have their own limitations and biases This lecture from the Hashgraph inventor and Hedera CTO Dr Leemon Baird at Harvard Business School taught me a lot In describing his new algorithm he provides a fairly easy to understand explanation of what DLT in general is the potential applications and the challenges involved he describes how Hashgraph relates to this and contrasts it to blockchain before fielding some questions that clarify a fair bit Theres a lot to learn and some of the more recent supporting material is necessary to describe the caveats of the Public DLT Hedera that has since been created Offsets are an imperfect solution and we should absolutely focus on reducing emissions in the first place the ability to add accountability for the source of the power does help in this regard though Take Project Guardian for example As you point out tokenizing and sending money extremely efficiently is but one use case the truth is you can tokenize anything DLT will actually be a fundamental component of the climate credit market being used to tokenize carbon offsets a digital and immutable representation of carbon footprint A particular property can be audited by trusted parties establishing overall environmental impact by looking at factors like soil conditions plant life sustainable practices etc The fact that you need to be able to trust the people putting the data in is something a lot of crypto enthusiasts seem to forget corruption is a major challenge that is yet to be overcome and may be an inevitable result of human input though the transparency of DLTs is an asset in this regard They are able to generate a figure for the CO2 sequestered from or contributed to the atmosphere and represent each unit of carbon as a token Put this on the ledger and you can trivially create a balance sheet This allows a farmer for instance to monetize their carbon footprint at no cost to themselves This also means there is a tangible incentive to choose sustainable practices even when short term profits are a matter of survival The companies purchasing these credits to level their balance sheet will be funding sustainable practices by outcome rather than intention Many will choose to offset these emissions themselves through direct action and with this market they will find that an even more fruitful endeavour Your concerns about the knock on effects of adoption are very valid and I agree that the focus of the study is too narrow to discuss wider implications sufficiently still some good perspective and discussion I will say that the infrastructure actually becomes much easier with this system with Governing Council member Standard Banks main goal being to use the minimal requirements internet connection and interface device to offer services where it simply has not been possible to set up that traditional infrastructure in the past The introduction of email enabled extremely efficient cheap and convenient communication with the ability to handle many multiples of the transaction volume of the legacy systems at the time with no issue the volume overwhelmed the systems within just a few weeks As people are capable of doing more things they naturally will They will also gradually become accustomed to these new capabilities and take them for granted eventually demanding more ad infinitum But for better or worse adoption of this technology in every single industry on the planet is very much around the corner the foundation is very much in place its important to remember that as of now the focus is on replacing legacy systems with a much more efficient alternative but the broader implications are impossible to measure as of now with positive and negative both apparent I hope the benefits outweigh the costs in terms of power consumption but if they dont the prospect were facing is more like that of email adoption significant and pervasive perhaps but nothing near the atrocious inefficiency of Blockchain architecture in which the users compete over a spot in an artificially limited data flow all that energy consumption is used for a pointless competition FFS Where it goes in the future as people start messing around with these new capabilities is impossible to tell its absolutely essential we question this kind of thing and do our best to keep each other accountable one reason I have so much faith in Hedera is that I feel they go to every effort to make themselves accountable and to be a positive influence being proactive in supporting sustainable and ethical practices is part of their ethos that Ive seen them consistently demonstrate in their actions yeah I know how I sound hahaha Cheers for a good and challenging line of questioning I hope I answered adequately and genuinely I understand you cannot simply trust the words of the creator and that is actually a big part of why I like to engage in these kind of discussions and put forth what Ive found for others to challenge Of course its a complex subject and the crypto market at large is essentially saturated by vapourware and empty promises of some shiny new tech Im getting involved in more

The key here is immutability applications where verifying the data is more important than speed of access or other concerns That may be a small subset of problems but Id expect financial services to be one of them Insurance too However the data is only immutable while a single operator stake or miner has less than 50 control over the entire block chain Which is of course a big problem in a world where so many tech giants are quite comfortable in their positions of monopolyoligopoly The ethereum network is the one I find most interesting along with polkadot I dont think it will change the world but it will certainly find its niche And imo anyone calling the currencies a scam doesnt understand how money was invented in the first place What you want me to give you an ENTIRE cow for that itty bitty peice of metal? Thats got to be a scam eh? yes some currencies are obviously scam Bit others more trustworthy after all money is just a thing we attribute value to to make trading easier Cryptocurrency is exactly that when enough people subscribe,1,1,0,1,0
The Immutability of the blockchain is not desirable even in the cases you mention You dont want financial transactions to be irreversible Every hack scam or accidental burn makes that obvious The blockchain just fails in this case Note as well that many software solutions offer immutability of data The blockchains actual proposition is that the APIs over the data maintain a balanced book of course this cant be 100 true due to the forking problem which is essentially a 2 generals type problem But theres no reason why a blockchain is needed for this Any solution with eventual consistency is an acceptable one especially if it has the advantage of fraud prevention and reversibility Also most blockchain currencies currently are scams The main issue is tether is clearly shady and is being used to manipulate the markets Without Tether providing fake liquidity the price would certainly not be where its at for every token The other issue is that if you want to make a profit from a truly decentralized project then you have to centralize it in some way or defraud people about it In the first case the decentralized nature is irrelevant and therefore no point to using the block chain in the second a scam,0,1,0,0,1

I think you are applying OOP to FN programing and not understanding how functional programs deal with impurities You can absolutely have immutable transaction data thats equivalent to saying yes this transaction happened to undo a transaction you would just apply the inverse of the target function as a separate transaction a refund in this case is the same transaction but with the accounts inverted and you dont want to overwrite the last transaction you want to records this new transaction as a refund This is how banks generally operate their system functional code that deals with immutable data you dont have to modify entries of the ledger to keep the ledger up to date you just add more transactions to the record You dont have an accounts ledger with everyones balance as an entry you have a immutable transactions ledger for each person In a bank setting where the have that lever to pull A list of things that happened to that account And you dont want some rando being able to change that you want that set in stone This still isnt a use case for blockchain as far as I know which deals with a public ledger of transactions for privately controlled transactions IE a bank there is zero benefit that I see I also see no case where immutability isnt desired in the programming sense I think we need to be cautious of our diction choices when speaking immutability can be defined much more loosegoosey as it was above I am also speaking out of my ass take with some grains of salt,0,1,0,1,0
If you are being more precise it is not immutability that is most important but nonexcludability namely you cannot restrict access or privilege within the system based on anything but the contents of a users wallet You are correct that a traditional blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum or PoS Ethereum are subject to 51 attacks which can not only be used to steal funds but can also be covertly used to remove the nonexcludability aspect of the chain by censoring transactions Worst part is just how sustainable these attacks can be especially when the attackers is not brazen about it,0,1,0,0,1

we are really early in this space mainly because 99 of people dont understand the underlying technology and the potential it has and the same people think its just jpgs and pump and dumps unfortunately web3 has been abused in that way so it has gotten a bad rep I would argue however that just like the internet in its early days blockchain is something most people wont accept until it becomes mainstream blockchainweb3 is all about digital ownership that can be verified programmatically This makes transactions fast and secure This is unlike web2 where someone can go in and change something in the database and erase that transaction without anyone knowing there is little to no transparency in web2 and there is very little trust With this in mind every single industry can be disrupted by blockchain and lots of economic and political problems can be solved This includes the stock market gaming voting law agreements music royalties cross border payments supply chain the list goes on and on Asking why blockchain is a thing at such an early stage is like asking in the 90s why the internet would ever be a thing in the future and look where we are now Question is as an engineer would you rather help make it happen or remain skeptical until its actually mainstream?,1,1,0,1,0

It eliminates the possibility of human error or malicious actors when expanding or contracting the money supply prevent manipulation of the money supply in support of ulterior policy goals and would generally increase faith in the financial system,1,0,0,1,0
With fiat currency there is no real tether to reality Since central banks can expand the money supply at will and also set interest rates there will always be political and economic interests that want to keep delaying deleveraging and continue increasing the debt burden as long as possible Ray Dalio is a mixed bag but this video is a good explanation of this general concept Imagine you could borrow 100 from a bank to buy a machine There are machines available that produce 20 bills 10 bills 5 bills and so on all the way down to a penny However they only produce one of these a year You are never going to pay back the principle on the loan you take out to buy this machine but you do need to service the debt If the annual interest rate in the above scenario was 6 what machines make sense to buy? The ones that print a 20 and a 10 since theyre the only ones that generate profit In a capitalist system business people are effectively borrowing money to buy these profit making machines companies However when interest rates are low say 0 it makes sense to buy any machine even the ones that make a penny ie low quality low margin businesses because everything is profit For this reason business owners pretty much always want low interest rates They also need money to borrow which is effectively infinite when there is a central bank that can produce more money at will I understand that the central bank does not directly loan to business people but the effect of expanding the money supply is the same Bubbles like those that ended in the past few financial crises are the direct result of expansionary fiscal policy which includes creating new money Anyways by forcing central banks to keep a certain amount reserves on deposit not currently the case in the US and not allowing central banks to control the money supply it places a limit on the debt burden an economy can accrue and prevents central banks and politicians from delaying deleveraging forever because they will eventually run out of new money to lend When the Federal Reserve Act was originally established the Fed needed to keep 40 gold reserves gold is a bad reserve for other reasons but I digress After the Nixon shock there was no longer a reserve requirement allowing the US to engage in expansionary fiscal policy ad inifinitum Having some control on the money supply such as an algorithm effectively prevents central banks from engaging in expansionary fiscal policy as long as they please because they are no longer the ones in control of that money supply and cant simply print more money to loan out whenever it suits them Also generally speaking there is a case to be made that financiers account for possible governmentregulator intervention when making risk assessment on their investments the too big to fail idea which is pretty unfair Algorithmically controlling the money supply potentially through airdropping new currency evenly to all wallets on a blockchain since it is fundamentally unfair to average wage earners that those closest to the source of new money benefit most the Cantillon effect but the exact mechanics arent important wont completely eliminate bubbles for sure But it would at least prevent things like we saw in 2020 where central banks purposely counteracted an economic downturn only for it to have negative longterm consequences the Kshaped recovery and inflation,0,1,0,0,1
Drawing this distinction between blockchain and cryptocurrency shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how a blockchain secures itself and what it secures itself from A blockchain secures itself from economic attacks which include bribery corruption physical takeover and censorship Those may not seem like economic attacks but truly they all encompass a credible class of attack which money can pay for this is not the case for basic encryption which the strongest supercomputer in the world could not crack with all the resources in the world poured into it making some reasonable assumptions The way a blockchain secures itself from economic attacks is by making any behavior an attacker must take expensive Since the necessary behaviors of honest participants overlap with attackers those behaviors common to honesty and attack must be subsidized in order for honest participants to participate in any sustainable fashion This subsidy or payment is made in the form of the privilege to use the network since the only requirement to use the network is to pay a fee and the network has desirable qualities as you say blockchain may have legitimate uses that payment is made in units that offer access to network operations namely a cryptocurrency If you are interested in rationalizing the use of blockchain without cryptocurrency then you either have to figure out what use blockchain has when it is not resilient to economic attacks that other databases do not or you have to find a way to protect against economic attacks that imposes zero cost on honest network participants,0,1,0,1,0
gtThe blockchain may have legitimate uses and there is work ongoing to find them but so far its not looking promising Its a good one in the world of finance and its too early to call cryptocurrency a scam especially now when it is being considered to be the standard for payment in certain cases The only reason why it may seem as though it is not up to speed is due to the high entry barrier into the space as a result of the rigid web3 authorization demands Although web2web3 bridges are working to simplify this The advantage of crypto usefulness in instant crossborder payments will be subsequently amplified thats for sure,1,1,0,1,0
Computer Science graduate from a top tier program here so hope that gives me a smidge of credibility Ignore the people calling cryptocurrencies a scam Are there scam cryptocurrencies? Yes of course Is crypto a scam? Not as an industry A scam is something that advertises and promises something that it never delivers It has helped a number of individuals across the world access financial services and cash that isnt at the will of their hyperinflation environment There were plenty of web2 websites that promised to transform how insert X product would be bought only online in the future There was a website got everything and shills claimed everything needed a website to survive because brick and mortar would entirely be no more Then the dot come bubble came and saw a ton of online businesses shuttered Sound similar to the way cryptocurrencies can be shilled and then rug pulled?

Its not really like a linked list a linked list is structured in such a way to make accessing strictly sequential data fast with arbitrary location for each element A blockchain references subsequent blocks in order to enforce consensus rules and the most efficient way to access unspent transactions certainly isnt by stepping back through blocks one at a time The point of a blockchain is to make a nonexcludable economic term consensus algorithm which is robust against economic attacks You are asking two questions one about venture capitalism and one about computer science It seems you are projecting your cynacism about one onto the other The beauty of blockchain is that they are by nature auditable if they are not then they are not even worth burning brain calories thinking about Most people do not have the skills required to look at a protocol understand it then project how that protocol will behave or be useful in the future or under heavy load That inability makes people vulnerable to putting money into consensus algorithms that have no future The main point is until you understand what blockchain does which couldnt have been done before you cannot effectively make judgements on what is useful or not The fact that you could pick a random coin or token and state that it is useless does not reflect any competence on your part and this proclivity for venture capitalists to often fail at creating something useful does not reflect on the usefulness of an abstract data structure blockchain in practice is arguably more than a datastructure it is an economic organization As for use cases obviously it is a secure medium of exchange barring user and developer error More fundamentally it is a digital asset with all the properties it purports to have Even more fundamentally it resolves the man in the middle attack trustlessly and is fundamentally more secure in theory depends on what chain you use in addition to be nonexcludable than what is used to resolve MITM today centralized PKI networks The reason it is not currently used for that yet is that the most well known chains cannot scale to meet the demand necessary to function as a PKI network without compromising nonexcludability or resistance to centralization,0,0,0,1,0

IMO the mistake people are making is to think that the things getting the most attention or the people trying to sell them represent the actual promise of Web3 or in some cases like the metaverse even have basically anything to do with it The early internet was mocked in the same way for the same reasons the startup concepts were stupid and obviously wouldnt work Everything the internet could do that people found comprehensible seemingly could already be done easier by traditional means like turning on a radio or going to a shop But it had properties that enabled things that were previously impossible interoperability of systems that couldnt be done otherwise and made things much more efficient Web3 also has powerful previously impossible core properties A properly deployed smart contract is untouchable no one can shut it down no one can prevent any person with an internet connection from accessing it It is borderless it is permissionless and it is trustless a sufficiently interested and sophisticated party can confirm that it will fulfill its promises without any sort of ongoing reliance that the entity that developed the contract will remain trustworthy and uncompromised And these systems can transact with onchain currency assets and cryptographic proofs in arbitrary ways In a world where corporations and governments are increasingly showing themselves to be untrustworthy unreliable and often malevolent maintainers of the systems we rely on that is huge That is real potential progress in the ongoing and nontrivial problems of human cooperation our civilization has always faced But what it isnt is a clear way for a person to become rich by investing in something and so the large number of people who were interested only for that reason are only disgusted if it seems like that will not materialize,0,1,0,1,1

Your skepticism is understandable especially given the amount of hype surrounding blockchain and Web3 These technologies have indeed attracted a mix of serious innovators and opportunistic actors However beneath the hype there are some genuinely transformative aspects of blockchain and Web3 that are worth exploring # 1 Blockchain as More Than a Glorified Data Structure While its true that blockchain can be described as a linked list with hashing and consensus algorithms its utility goes beyond just being a data structure Decentralization and Trust Blockchain enables decentralized systems where trust is distributed among participants rather than centralized in a single entity This has significant implications for industries like finance where intermediaries have traditionally been gatekeepers Immutability and Transparency The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once data is recorded it cannot be altered which is critical for applications requiring high levels of security and transparency like supply chain tracking or voting systems Smart Contracts These are selfexecuting contracts with the terms directly written into code They automate processes that typically require intermediaries reducing costs and increasing efficiency in industries like insurance real estate and beyond ,0,1,0,1,0
The goal of Web3 is to bring physical assets into the digital age and allow true digital ownership People who claim that big tech wont allow it are probably correct but what about a new startup that uses crypto to give people true ownership of the content they create?

Im not sure but it appears that crypto enthusiasts do It will be interesting to see if it is useful to the general public I have a hard time believing that web20 users who have grown accustomed to free services will be willing to pay for web3 services Benefits such as privacy and ownership are not valued by the average person The exceptions are financial dapps where usage is expected to generate a profit dapps that compete with highfee apps and dapps that distribute earnings to users If you want to know where the next big ideas will come from look where the money and smart developers are going has always been a truism in Silicon Valley In the case of Web3 there has been no shortage of funds On the other hand only a few developers have decided to join the bandwagon Tea is a web 3 tool developed by a group of wellknown developers including those behind the homebrew tool Smart contracts allow for codeenforced contracts Blockchain technology can be used to own digital assets This is a game changer in the financial world Ill use gaming assets as an example so that people can understand what Im talking about You can work hard for items in a WoW game putting in a lot of time and effort but youll be out of luck if Blizzard decides to ban your account for no apparent reason You have no legal claim to them You can truly own these items thanks to the blockchain They will not be taken away from you by Blizzard There are even assets on the blockchain that can be used in a variety of games We continue to use our phones as computers and our computers as phones despite this I mostly trust developers in this process because they have a good understanding of the game Web3 will make the internet more equitable by allowing individuals to be sovereign To be truly sovereign one must have control over ones time and information as well as who benefits from it Web 3 developers such as Max Howell the creator of Homebrew are working on a new project called Tea for Web 3 What are your thoughts on this?,1,0,0,1,1

You still need the blockchain to be run by someone The people with the most resources to mine will be the winners here That doesnt change just because its decentralized Something blockchain supporters dont seem to understand is that cryptography isnt only a blockchain thing Using cryptography you can hide things even though someone else has your data You can verify ownership with your private key and signatures This isnt exclusive or even new to block chain Block chain just creates a public ledger for it to facilitate transactions One thats really slow and expensive to maintain No ones going to stand at the gas pump for a few minutes waiting for their block chain transactions to confirm before they pump gas And somewhat hilariously all the solutions to that seem to be just another form of centralizing the transaction model ,0,1,0,0,1

I am somewhat divided on this topic I feel like there are true benefits to Web3 You dont feel powerless against a somewhat anonymous entity like fb or Google You may ! have better and more convenient methods to contribute to a project eg vote via token You may ! save on middleman transaction fees amp#x200B However I fully agree with much of the criticism eg from Molly White and think there are serious issues which are often linked to fundamental misconceptions about how humans can organize themselves in groups There is no real value in a noncommunity hence centralized Web3 project It just makes developping so much more cumbersome Community projects are often based on intrinsic motivation and strong ethical beliefs of its members You cannot replicate this with financial incentives Adding financial incentives will completely change how people interact with the project Without financial incentives you run into these typical community problems like lack of leadership in times of disagreement inefficiencies and instability over time especially when the project grows,1,1,0,0,1

Its still quite early to be expecting mainstream adoptionhowever you would measure that it is not out of the realm of possibility that it might not work either But Ill try to point out a few things that I have to remind myself all the time and why I think that Web3 is inevitable 1 Some of the brightest minds are working on this Ive never seen a group of individuals from all walks of life trying to solve problems that face the future of Web3 It is the intersection of so many specializations law politics economics technology Because of this Im very hopeful for the outcomes that we will see in the next decade Even if we dont have that fully decentralized internet running on blockchains whatever will come out of it it will be interesting and Im super exited about it 2 Before Web1 we were building protocols and ways for nodes to communicate in order to send and receive data With the TCPIP protocol we enabled nodes to locate eachother and send arbitrary data to each other This was the foundation of the internet Only after those protocols were developed did we have mainstream adoption TCPIP was being developed throughout the 70s and early 80s Mainstream Web1 only came to be in the 90s Currently we are still trying to figure out protocol level solutions that will make our vision of Web3 work Polkadot and Eth2 are those Layer 0 protocols that will connect isolated blockchain networks and enable them to speak to one another There is a fractal effect happening here at first we were simply connecting nodes to build networks now we are trying to now figure out how to make networks speak to other networks This is a difficult problem to solve and will take time We will fail many times and we will learn from those mistakes and keep building 3 Your last point is interesting and I believe there are multiple possibilities of how a cultural reset might impact the development of Web3 In one potential you might be right we might need a massive crisis to finally see the value of these Web3 technologies and only then will they make sense hence leading to a general adoption But also a much worse cultural reset in the form of a world war might erase centuries of development Id like to quote Albert Einstein here to paint the picture I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones 4 We need a better system in order to scale our civilization to where we are going The old systems to verify validate and secure data is no longer sufficient enough for where we are headed Blockchains solve this Centralized systems have failed us far too many times and the stakes are getting higher and higher we need better So to say the least your skepticism is well received I think its quite reasonable but in my view looking at the history of how we have been decentralizing and centralizing in different forms as a species in all aspects of our lives I believe Web3 to be a inevitable it just might not end up what we might think it is right now Hope this helps,1,0,0,1,1

A new form of social media catching on let alone a Web3 one is incredibly hard because of the network effect that Facebook has today That is thats where most everyone hangs out and if you were to join a new network like Mastodon it would be quite lonely until tons more people show up So its a bit of a Catch22 until little by little a tipping point is reached For it to take off it may have to follow Facebooks trajectory young people joining while its still cool and as more and more of them do and word gets out then their parents and other older people will follow in droves Thats actually not entirely unlikely to happen Facebook already has a massive problem in that teenagers think its lame in big part because their parents have joined in droves and have overrun it with boomer nonsense and also because of Facebook shooting itself in the foot with the cringey decisions theyve made in recent years and recently it became apparent that the 2130 year old demographic is doing a mass exodus as well Theyre going to TikTok and Instagram and the like primarily because those are cooler platforms and their parents arent on them  but TikTok and Instagram offer a different type of social media experience than Facebook so there is a void to potentially fill and younger people are much more likely to try a Web3 alternative for similar reasons as why theyve taken to crypto they generally understand technology better and are more open to trying new things To sell them on the Web3 alternative though you need to think beyond the word decentralized because that doesnt mean anything to normies To sell younger people and eventually older ones too on a Web3 social media experience I think youd have to highlight a censorshipresistant platform where there isnt a central authority who decides what can and cant be discussed transparency around the algorithms that decide what people are shown and shared governance for how those algorithms evolve a shared revenue model of some sort where instead of users on Facebook being the product and our data being packaged and sold to advertisers users are actually paid for spending time on the platform from the advertisement dollars flowing in Imagine a world where you actually earn tokens that have real value for spending time on social media  you basically flip the model where instead of Facebook executives and their shareholders earning the majority of the profits from the advertisements being run on their platform to a model where team who created and manages this new Web3 social media app getting fairly compensated for their work and the rest of the profits being shared with users in the form of those token rewards Oh and users are also able to control and own their data and decide whether they want to optin to the advertisement model I believe BAT Basic Attention Token is already doing something like this with their web browser Im not an expert on the economic model by any means and am just riffing here so it would need much more refinement but it could possibly look something like this On the subject of NFTs I think they are getting ridiculed in pop culture mostly for valid reasons  it is at least on a surface level a bit ridiculous to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for some art that some would say isnt very good Theres a lot of flipping for profit and it can look like a ponzi scheme from the outside looking in That said art is of course very subjective and if someone really likes the look of something and wants to definitely say that they own a one of a kind piece of digital property it is cool that they are able to pay for the right to do so However the bigger problem is that the media and normies are completely overlooking that this is just the first NFT use case thats caught on but there will be many more with much greater realworld utility Imagine if early adopters of email bought computers solely for the purpose of sending cat memes to each other and everyone else dismissed email and the internet as a fad When NFTs evolve to settling property deeds vehicle registrations and other legal contracts is when itll all start making more sense,0,1,0,1,0

These days it seems that privacy coins and protocols are on the rise with interesting projects indeed and dont get me wrong I appreciate keeping my wallets and transactions out of nosy individuals and let alone keeping my addresses far from hackers as far as I can but Monero have been delisted please read kicked out from many exchanges in order to comply with regulations demands Even when LiteCoin was about to add some privacy features it was also delisted from some exchanges Regulators will never accept privacy projects as it will keep the tax man at bay and we all know how governments love to collect its taxes right? All the claims against crypto and money laundering are easily avoided when a public ledger as Bitcoin has is in place with semi anonymous wallet addresses with all the information verifiable! When it comes to oracles like ChainLink it surprises me why most of them dont have their data feeds fully verifiable from data collection to its delivery? Why some process is made off chain? I understand about the costs but the added value for a guarantee of untampered DATA would be worth I believe As far as I know Dia Data is one of the few exceptions Going back to Bitcoin it also could be a proof of stake faster more scalable less energy hungry etc but it would bring trust into the equation which in the end of the day is what crypto is about trustless transaction Bottom line I believe that the crypto space should actually invest more resources on the transparency instead of in privacy when it comes to a healthy future of the space,0,1,0,1,1
Transparency is very important I liked how MAXX Finance founders and team are doxxed and KYCd for our protection,1,0,0,1,0
POV The most crucial aspect of the cryptoverse is security and transparency Blockchains were designed to take control away from a few and give more decentralization in every way which is why I believe blockchains like Elrond are working well enough to ensure that the Blockchain trilemma is perfectly solved and this extends to projects built on them such as holoride which is one of my top picks and has even partnered with CooperHq in that regard,1,0,0,1,0

Ok ok I know this is not gonna be a popular opinion here but give it an honest read amp#x200B Theres a big movement in which many people talk about a new type of Internet and which will all take back control from the big centralized players We will do this by having wallets and taking custody and responsibility for our own digital identities and money This illusion is grounded on the misunderstanding of how few people really understand technology For most people signing up for the average website is quite a feat Remembering a password is a serious challenge This study gives us a good look at how limited the average computer user really is wwwnngroupcomarticlescomputerskilllevels 26 couldnt even use a computer Only 5 could find out what percentage of the emails sent by John Smith last month were about sustainability Making your own bitcoin wallet is stratospheric compared to the hardest task they gave people and naturally limits the entire ecosystem to the top one percent of computer users A great example of a recent migration to a centralized platform is the gamer population that moved from self hosted systems like team speak to discord Every community manager knows that if you trust your community to another platform you might lose it It takes a lot to put that trust in a platform but the ease of use slowly chipped away at the self hosted solutions The reason people migrate to centralized platforms is because theyre a lot easier to use The idea that were all going to use the Blockchain as a decentralized foundation to a future where we take control fundamentally misunderstands peoples priorities namely ease of use People generally dont care about privacy outside of the tech niche Even when they do its very hard to compete with the centralized platforms which has all of the other people that you want to connect with Gamers are probably the most technologically savvy group of them all and they took the longest to switch to hosted solutions but they too have switched and are unlikely to go back So whats the solution?

Part of the theory is that there would be freeandopensource solutions for the respective community management software and people would be able to easily spin off their own version of it All of the networking would be done they would just change the name and so on for their community If they wanted to develop further their implementation whatever changes they make could be done in such a way to be addable to the main software improving it Such instances of networked software could also be federable so communities could be open to each other if the hosts choose it For the end user in theory the userfriendliness should be identical It shouldnt matter if they choose discord or some FOS software that is being selfhosted by some community manager with skins and styling having been developed by another third party because the end user experience should be the same I think the community has failed to do that though They have failed to build these solutions in ways that would take off Now I dont blame the people building the software because the software is usually good I more blame the lack of third party modders to take a good piece of softare and find a way for they themselves to profit from implementing a change to it that increases userfriendliness There are many many examples but I can give one Imagine decentralized exchanges versus centralized exchanges If people are truly going to centralized exchanges just because they have a nicer user interface then what stops someone from taking a decentralized exchange proven secure adding their own frontend putting it up on a website paying for marketing and advertising and pocketing the difference in money in fees between what the notthatprofitable decentralized exchange makes and what the veryprofitable centralized exchange makes? By doing so they would be increasing the usage of the decentralized exchange so whatever profit they make would be earned until their features get brought into the core software or the features can be not added and they can continue just profiting from the additional user interface features they brought in That is with respect to exchanges but it applies to everything else this can be done with nonweb3 federated software as well,0,1,0,1,0

I dont think the original creators foresaw the issues that decentralization would create it was much better in their mind than it is today in reality One example must be what Im reading currently on semantic immutability Finally any blockchain that supports Turingcomplete8 onchain execution eg Ethereum Hyperledger and Tezos cannot enforce semantic immutability This is because such blockchains cannot prevent contracts from being upgradeable a Turing Machine is capable of simulating any other Turing Machine9 allowing for upgradeability via interpreted inputs even if the onchain code is immutable For example Alice can submit a transaction to a contract and before the transaction is mined the contract could be upgraded to have completely different semantics The transaction would be executed against the new contract Upgradeable contract patterns have become incredibly popular in Ethereum as they allow developers to circumvent immutability to patch bugs after deployment But they also allow developers to patch in backdoors that would allow them to abscond with a contracts assets The challenge with using a blockchain is that one has to either a accept its immutability and trust that the programmers did not introduce a bug or b permit upgradeable contracts or offchain code that share the same trust issues as a centralized approach Fascinating,0,1,0,0,1
But that was also the internet 10 years after it was invented It was slow people were saying it was unnecessary because the world was working fine without it and the UIUX was terrible But when people started to use it they invented a loooot of new stuff that was previously unthinkable YouTube Netflix Online games chat etc So let me give you some examples of ideas that the Web3 can offer when the performance problems are fixed These ideas are very basic but I think they will allow unthinkable new way better ideas for the future After all who could image weird things like videoconferences being a thing before the internet? Revolutionise fintech Money will be programmable Youll be able to automate bank transfers on different conditions Like 15 days prior Valentines Day pay this amount to this vendor From that you can build it as complex as you like Government approved NFTs You could have your home ownership certificate as an NFT and sell your house in a blink without the current bureaucratic process that we have to do today Hell you could buy and sell 3 houses per hour Real state live trading? Makes sense? Maybe! Well see You could also have your car and many other things as an NFT No more passwords and usernames You identify with your wallet simple as that Government digital ID tied to the Blockchain This would allow you to get any bureaucratic process digitally done which this is already partially implemented in many countries but the web3 could give it a last push to make it finally useful Imagine every app would be allowed to verify the user is a real person in a blink Bye bye long KYC processes!

I think your points are still focusing on the present rather than the future Centralised services are needed now for the Blockchain to be accessible Yes thats betraying the principle of it but its necessary only temporarily until the technology evolves until its efficient enough that centralised services are not needed anymore Anything Ive said is possible without Blockchain yes but its the perfect excuse to build these things Because sure an NFT for a house could be traded online on a centralised service but then every government would have their own system that is not connect to the other ones So whats neutral ground? Bitcoin NFTs on the Bitcoin chain would offer a global Blockchain so all the world can exchange compatible NFTs if so they desire It could also be done in Cardano when they release control to the community hopefully I like Cardano I think its the one with most potential to be a government compatible chain You are talking about everything is public but there are many chains that support private transactions being Monero the most prominent example Also Cardano wants to implement them as an optional feature With a transaction in Cardano you will be able to disclose which information you want to show and which to hide You could even make the actual transaction and then a second transaction with an encrypted message to the government which they hold the key to decrypt it and only you and them know the details of the transaction Private ledgers are not an issue anymore they can be done,1,0,0,1,1

There are many issues that need solving but one I am frustrated with is the onrampofframp process Unfortunately unless banks and processors are forced to work with this tech it is in their best interest to keep it at bay since it threatens their core business Creating apps with good user experience is easy Its the infrastructure and resistance to the tech is what complicates the process since these web3 apps have to do a hodge podge workarounds just to accomplish basic tasks As for rewards I cant speak much about that as I dont feel its relevant to the adoption conversation,0,0,1,0,1
Let me give you an example Email It used to be feasible to spin up your own email server and email people but today getting your mail into the inbox is really hard The reason spam Spam is just one factor of added complexity that encouraged companies to gate which emails enter your inbox Time and time again layers of complexity have been added to safeguard individual email users We see this sort of increase of complexity across the board and with increasing complexity you need adaptive systems Decentralization and adaptivity dont go hand in hand Example encryption The standard of privacy for email is awful and we have not been able to meaningfully fix it for decades Social media platforms are able to bring in endtoend encryption seemingly over night,0,1,0,1,1
Email is a technology Messaging is the application This could all be done across a decentralized Whatsapp Email is a flawed protocol Messaging is the purpose and there are technical solutions to the concerns you have These dApps just havent become ubiquitous enough for you or I to be aware of them yet For email you could build an encrypted dApp messaging platform on IFS and send push notifications via a Blockchain No spam because the exchanges are encrypted under a signed key so no senders can share the key with others To the end user it can look exactly like WhatsApp,1,0,0,1,0
gtThis could all be done across a decentralized Whatsapp Each social network has value in the number of people that use it a decentralized Whatsapp would have to complete with centralized versions which can iterate quickly adapt and improve and focus on user needs Very few care about privacy what they care about is usability otherwise Facebooks 3 billion monthly active users would have left a long time ago Its very hard to get that same sort of customerfocused usability in a decentralized ideologicallydriven tech gtFor email you could build an encrypted dApp messaging platform on IFS and send push notifications via a Blockchain No spam because the exchanges are encrypted under a signed key so no senders can share the key with others Why do you need the Blockchain for this? How does it solve any problem a centralized database cannot do faster or cheaper?,0,1,0,1,0
Pros dApps couldwould be interoperable The network could be shared Lack of centralization means faster adaptability and better focus on the users rather than focusing on the customers like current platforms Multiple front ends could be developed at the same time by multiple players With cApps users are the product not the customer Users care about privacy because they dont like spam You said spam was a problem on email I say encryption stops spam You say privacy doesnt matter? Spam doesnt matter?,1,1,0,1,0
How are you maintaining the chain what is the incentive structure? Really I see a lot of these big ideas in Web3 in general please dont take personally but in practice I dont see it coming together How does encryption stop spam?

I dont think personal insults actually helps push forward the conversation As someone thats spent the last 10 years researching the metaverse I dont think being a Luddite is something anybody accuses me of on a daytoday basis I still think the metaverse is quite a few years away but I work all day and night on it x000D x000D So lets get into the details here if were proposing a system in which two people are going to exchange messages over IPFS how are 2 people building the connection and what do they exchange in order to begin messaging each other? I assume this is on a dapp built on the Blockchain? x000D x000D Why would they use the blockchain in the first place to make such an application? It just seems like a really inefficient way of doing it That plus you would need zero knowledge proofs to protect privacy across the chain All of this is going to become extremely cumbersome over time and cost a lot How are you going to sustain this? Who pays that cost?,0,1,0,1,1
Sorry It seems you have an agenda when you say this wont work and even if it could work there is not a reason to do it How a messaging dApp could work to create the connection two users generate a key signed by both parties The senders app automatically creates an encrypted IPFS message and automatically posts the signed key to the Blockchain to the receivers wallet The use of the Blockchain enables an open push to notify the receivers dApp of the new message This is one way to do it I am sure their are many others ZKP could make it more efficient but I dont see a absolute need for it The user deriving value pays for it,0,1,0,1,0

I think if a Web3 company manages to crack the code for onboarding everyday Web2 usersthose who might not know much about crypto or DeFithey could really make a big splash It might come down to perfecting UX copywriting or brand messaging and it could take some time But getting this right could set the stage for becoming a major player in the Web3 space I could be off base but Id love to hear your thoughts and insights on this!,1,0,0,1,0
I couldnt agree more The thing with web2 is that users typically didnt pay attention to the infra behind the apps and products they used it was usually the devs who cared about this If anything users care about great UIUX However with web3 the focus has shifted to the underlying infra and users need to understand these complexities before they are onboarded On top of that devs now have to learn new programming languages to keep up with building web3 products Not only is the UX but devs are also facing challenges If both the UX and DevX improve we can expect better onboarding Of course web3 brands will also need to approach marketing and branding like web2 brands connecting with end users through effective messaging Web3 infra like PWR Chain could usher in this new paradigm shift considering its support for deploying software applications onchain I expect it to improve DevX allowing users to access sophisticated apps with a UX that feels as familiar as web2 experiences I expect more Wwb3 infra projects to follow this approach it would be a good start,1,0,0,1,0
I think this is only part of the problem In reality I feel like two things need to come in place 1 Perspective on crypto needs to change which can happen through regulation and killer use cases 2 Applications using web3 to solve HUGE problems where it doesnt even matter that the UX is crappy bc it solves such a big problem for users and theyll do anything to use your product,1,1,0,0,1

Because most of the persons working in the fields are not on Reddit as far as I read and tend to use Twitter You might get something useful on rChainlink but not too sure about it In my personal opinion the concept of web3 in general is not really understood and end up being just a buzz word Blockchain technology cannot exist alone and require expertise from web2 You can be working on smart contract o some front end but web3 should be providing a solution using the Blockchain as a fundamental part of it So far I see few solutions and a lot of copypaste that repeat over and over how the Blockchain is used there are exceptions of course From a strict job point of view web3 is not different to web2 you want to be a dev? Improve your skill on programming logic add programming languages most used technical writing git and so on and go for it You want to be OPS know the cloud thing and go for it The web3 part of the job is that you understand what the Blockchain is and what part you are playing in all that world Web3 as web2 ou cloud or AI are just labels You are an engineer or try to work on IT field then do IT stuff,0,1,0,1,0
Thats reassuring Im already experienced in web2 and Im just scared to fall for a hype instead of working in a promising field I personally believe in blockchain technology and that it could bring a lot to humanity The issue isnt my belief in the tech the issue is that it seems like there isnt actually real job offers on the market it either feels like a huge scam and waste of time or its an offer for someone with huge experience in blockchain technology professionally I dont seem to find job that can allow someone to bridge from web2 to web3 aka working with solidity etc,0,1,0,1,1

IMHO web3 is still in its infancy That being said it has or will have huge potential down the line I think the current web3 environment is starting to take shape in such a manner that is becoming more and more feasible economicallyfinancially The reason that I am bringing this up is that web3 still has to compete with web2 protocols and the biggest downsides are 1 web3 costs money to use and 2 web3 requires widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by the general public As time goes on assuming that current trends keep going more and more people will start using it because cryptos are entering the mainstream slowly and the web3 tech is taking huge steps forward with its innovation think layer 2 solutions that are much better at offering cheap transactions with little to no loss in data integrity and in time sharding will completely break the scale in web3s favor If you want to make a comparison to the early days of the internet a lotta people saw its potential but nobody really knew how to make that potential a reality However as time went on people started to get the picture more and more people started using it more and more things made use of the internet and now you fridge has a bridge to the internet go figure Ill finish my tangent with regards to your question about job opportunities web3 is going to revolutionize how we transact with one another and I think very few companies can really benefit from it Because of its decentralized nature inherently giving up centralized control and that is something companies drool over so they can exploit it financially Current web3 devs are looking to build products by themselves to launch on their own and selling their ownership tokens to the public This widespread ownership is just not what contemporary companies are very keen on Forgive me for the long read but my passion took over!

Unless you are unreasonably optimistic about the realism and sustainability of current decentralized ledger technology there really is no reason to believe that it will at all contribute to the current infrastructure challenges Just think about what NFTs are Non Fungible Tokens that live on a ledger and that token references a jpeg somewhere on the internet I will admit that not all NFTs live on the internet but those are in real space somewhere and linked to some contract I do not see decentralization to be a big part of the web in the way web 3 purports In fact it already exists in P2P networks However the content that we consume and the way we consume it does not lead to models that aligns to this truly decentralized manner of thinking and anything short of that purist decentralized view does not actually solve any of the free internet problems today So no Crypto and block chain have been big targets in my consulting space but there havent been any earth shattering moves yet And with the current trend where many are starting to realize that it is one big expensive pyramid scheme I doubt this space can exist outside of start ups in its current form Not saying it will never at all happen but the current major block chains are too expensive to mine or need centralized hubs to operate more efficiently imo that defeats the entire purpose,0,1,0,0,1

I doubt it I would suggest researching OpenFlow and IPv6 and their adoption in the market and where both technologies went wrong This will give you clues on what Web3 needs to avoid and solve for it to be widely adopted The biggest hurdle I see is the entire internet and all privatepublic networks run the current solutions In order to make it successful web3 will not only need to solve our current problems across the majority of deployments it will also need to provide justification andor cost savings for adoption,0,1,0,1,1
Hey team Im invested in a projects like Vabble and a few other cryptos that i think can take off if web3 technology does What are the thoughts from the community around web3 and the cryptos associated? Now could be a life changing time to invest in some of these companies that are leaning heavily into web3 There are so many to choose from though from security and storage platforms to entertainment and social platforms Think this is the next big thing?

The problem with web3 is the major players like Unstoppable isnt actually pushing it to replace web2 Like I flat out asked a month or so ago in a AMA if they are or if they know of something like Google indexing and making a search for web3 And they said they had no plans on that amp#x200B While there is some smaller web3 search sites Mainstream isnt going to go there first It basically runs into the same problem as TOR Where while there is TOR search sites You cant go to the main ones like Google or whatever and get there You have to 1 jump through hoops just getting your browser to see the sites 2 jump through hoops at finding a good search site or maybe a post somewhere showing a web 3 site you might want to visit amp#x200B I dont care about all the solutions people throw at this Like stopping link rot If this fundamental thing doesnt get fixed in web 3 then its basically dead on arrival Like right now why would someone use a web 3 site vs web 2? Even more why would something like Amazon use a web 3 side vs web 2? Again keep in mind no one will be able to search one of the major ones like Google to find their web 3 site And people will have to jump through hoops to get it to work amp#x200B amp#x200B I think web 3 will have its day But I dont think we are near that day And investing into any web 3 project because web 3 is foolish since the project might not be alive by the time web 3 becomes mainstream IF it does,0,1,1,0,1
Chances are there will be a web 3 and then web 2 used on top of that meaning like Amazon where things are super dynamic You will have the main static layout and other bits be web 3 Same with the link but everything else will be on a centralized server side Things on web 3 calling out for things on the server side This making it where the main part of the site is decentralized and this saving the company money and storage space amp#x200B But the problem with this is in situations like this your database is already so large that the little bit for the static side is a drop in the bucket So IDK if companies will find this a true savings,0,1,0,1,0

Web3 is much more a control and organizational change than it is a change to underlying technology implementations Think more about reimplementing Twitter or Reddit but decentralized even to the point that the algorithms that determine what shows up in your feed are under your control Its not only a huge technological change but likely leads using new built from scratch applications I think the point when apps that embody this concept reach mainstream is likely still 10 to 20 years away if that  it may be that decentralized apps fail to reach critical mass or commercial success And at some level decentralized apps have also been here all along with apps such as BitTorrent As for how that might effect DevOps? Think about traditional web 20 apps theyre usually provisioned and controlled by single centralized infraascode projects Web3 breaks those large deployments into many parts running in many places More logic in easily updateable clientside apps weve already moved a huge way here with SPA apps in the last 10 years but the data that decentralized apps pull from may come from many different backends So building custom clouds that each of these backends can easily be deployed into each one carrying some decentralized slice of that data But it really depends upon what youre decentralizing and how for the most part good DevOps knowledge and practices will apply the same to wellarchitected web 20 or Web3 apps the same Unless youre crafting a resume or LinkedIn to appeal to a specific job market  then it should sound completely different P,0,1,0,1,0
All the people saying its fake dumb or related to crypto and NFTs need to sit down Web3 revolves around the idea of extending your own identitylike providers for your own data on the web such that it isnt centrally stored and monetized by you not large corps The more obvious use cases being payment and self custody of digital assets Unfortunately its not trivial and its not user friendly because its new and uncharted territory Its going to mature its not a buzz word nor a marketing ploy tho Im sure many companies and people do use it from those angles to ride the hype Realistically it has merit in finance related systems where the user is quite tech savvy to understand how to plug in and almost no where else right now But you could apply it to storingsharing your own health records your own money your shopping habits heck even your timeattention on the web one could even imagine music artists sharing music with you directly instead of through centralized systems I personally think its going to revolutionize how we look at using the web specifically about being aware what data we actually produce or should own or didnt know companies owned of us gdpr comes to mind People who dont want to be part of it or think its a fad remind me of the same ppl who said email was a fad Its really just cutting out the middleman in the digital world and as a result requires much more care on the user side NFTs and custodying digital assets are just the first implementations And no it wont replace centralized corporations not until some measure of usability matches an army of paid employees but I sort of trust itll iron itself out by in due time So yes I think its worth keeping up with what web3 means and what role it might have this decade,1,1,0,1,0

Youve probably heard of Lil Miquela already Although the hype around her digital persona is already rock bottom she has been quite impressive for a nonphysical being How did it lead to this and what awaits us in the future assuming it hasnt come already? ## Whats Web 30? Throughout the past 30 years the Internet has gradually entered three stages of its development Web 10 Web 20 and Web 30 Heres how they are different from each other ### Web 10 Companies create content and sell information to the Internet users via the means of advertisement Customers read what they find online and the companies get money for it ### Web 20 This is when global corporations stepped into the game Social media platforms such as Meta get money from their users with the help of advertisement on this level not much has changed Whats different is that content is created by users instead of companies Now customers are both those who create and those who consume ### Web 30 Applications communities and platforms are decentralized and belong to all the Internet users instead of just one company Anyone could build a project use it and get money from it ## What does it mean for crypto? Metaverse already opened up plenty of new opportunities for the world of cryptocurrencies In the future well have to use crypto in order to buy digital assets and land in the metaverse therefore increasing demand for crypto and its development GrayScale Investments claimed that the Web 30 metaverse industry will increase its annual profit up to 1 trillion This number is higher than any other economic sector yet Virtual platforms that use crypto DeFi NFT and cloud storage technologies attract much more users by creating new forms of integration with the real world ## How will the metaverse affect us? Creating the metaverse was a big step for humanity People around the world take part in implementing their ideas into the virtual world with the help of stateoftheart technologies that thankfully are known to us today ### Social experience Metaverse will unite a lot of avatars some of them might be just artificial intelligence others might be influential in the real world Well be able to meet new people and communicate with them in a way that will be much more lifelike than videochat Avatars will allow us to express our feelings with facial expressions in the metaverse ### Personalization In fact the metaverse will give us all the same opportunities as social media only at a much bigger scale Well be able to buy and sell land build and obtain real estate and change the digital world in any way possible ### Development With the help of the metaverse humanity will be able to create new communities develop economies and the Internet without any boundaries While the metaverse may seem like a twin of the real world at first it might become a completely different place in the future not limited by our expectations or imagination ## What projects will we see in the meantime? Developers spend a lot of time implementing their ideas into the virtual world In the near future we will see the rise of new projects that will change our perception of reality Facebook Instagram and Reddit started investing into crypto to create new meta opportunities for their users One of the most interesting Web3 social networks Ive seen recently is Raritygram Its a new project that will merge the concepts of social media NFT marketplace and blockchain on one platform The project has already gained lots of support from crypto enthusiasts over the first 24 hours of Raritygram Mint users bought 100000 worth of NFTRarity tokens Its exciting to see what the Metaverse has in store for us and what opportunities they bring to our world What are your thoughts on the metaverse?

It solves the users problem if the user has a problem with a centrally planned service Example an ecommerce platform has a stranglehold on e commerce because they have managed to build out such an amazing supply chain no one else can offer similar service However their supply chain is just a sum of parts They have just gained the recognition for putting the parts together well and orchestrating the automation of it If an open source system were deployed which used blockchain to validate the supply chain states and automated the sending and receiving of goods in the most efficient way then the ecommerce player which had such a stranglehold on the industry could potentially become just a burdensome middleman I only see this happening though if ecommerce abuses its power to the point where people are desperate for other options If their vendors arent happy with the cuts they are getting and their customers arent happy with the savings because the service is eating too much between,1,1,0,1,0

Yeah I do think blockchain might be the only way a larger scale website could be effectively hosted without centralized planning I think the problem some have imagined solving is migrating from open source software to open source services crowd hosted through blockchain to avoid the need for a central controller Admittedly I havent researched Web 30 to see if it comes close to solving this problem though This also goes in the opposite directions businesses would want to use it for since it would actually eliminate monetary gain for services similar to how open source does for plugins and packages Open source crowd hosted social media networks Open source crowd hosted online marketplaces you name it,0,1,0,1,0

I think most people are missing the bigger implementations of Web 30 and how it mirrors the pain points and cracks society and government are going through There are all these politicians ie participants in a system whos actions should reflect their goal Ie If a Prime Minister is a participant in a system what actions are they doing? Are these actions efficient? What is the goal of the systemgovernment and are the actions the aligned with that goal? What actionsvalues do we encourage any participants of the system and do those those actions actually align with the goal of the system? Take for example saving money Our systems tell us participants in a system that saving money is good for you but that is horrible advice when there is major inflation going on saving is the last thing you want to do We need to make sure we encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior of any participant Think about it fundamentally the problem Web 30 is trying to solve is the same problem any society or group of people is trying to solve Self governing having efficiency protocolsfunctions for decision making conflict resolution awarding participants whos actions represent the group best interest accountability privacy trustless system reducing barriers to entry and reducing middle man are some things that come to mind From a programming point of view centralized and decentralized have pros and cons and instead of pinning one against the other we should combine those characteristics where possible For example I love the concept of private key and public key to encrypt your centralized database and you can already see this kinda stuff being used for password hashes This prevents you from getting hacked ensures security and privacy I used to think web30 was this big beast but its really not If you wanted to develop a Web 30 app the main feature actions are 1 Authenticatesign with meta mask 2 Send tokens 3 Check balance 4 Stake tokens this one is huge and has massive use cases for example I want to play a game where 4 people stake their money and after smart contract is executed 1 person randomly gets all staked funds If we were to do that today your funds could get stuck in some middle man ie banks companiesstrippaypal etc This is horrible because middle man control the most important thing which is the money and ultimately have the final say If I dont like your opinion or goes against I could seize all your funds to stop you being my competition The functions that exist in our societygovernment are scary such as seizing funds Now when I create a Web 30 app Im still using a centralized database to record logs and literally doing everything else the same but things pertaining to those above actions just call a different api depending on chain you choose Web 30 is pretty much like importing stripe payment except its a trustless system and has awesome features like staking removing middle man and creating this trustless system A big issue holding Web 30 from really taking off currently is the insane gas fees for sendingstaking tokens There are tokens out there solving this such as pulse which is a fork of eth20 so it has proof of stake reducing electricity bill but also has super low transactions fees like less than pennies Before if I wanted to play that same game with 4 people staking their money and one person receiving all of it no one wants to pay 20100 dollars just to stake their tokens and it cancels out use case right away but if its less than pennies to interact with those above web 30 actions then we are in business We live in some exciting times ,1,0,0,1,1

Thanks for this comment Even now there are over 6 million apps available on the major app stores How many of those really do something relevant?

I have been working on DeFi for over 2 years now and I struggle to see use cases outside of DeFi and Gaming There are several things that have been mentioned here on why Web3 hasnt taken off but I disagree that is stopping the adoption UX is bad We have heard about this several times Lets say if that we to go away still it is hard to see value for people jumping over to DeFi or other blockchain projects and leaving their existing solutions behind Ownership of data I believe it to be a good thing but unfortunately an average person doesnt care about it So it is hard to see anyone migrating to Web3 because they can own their data There are a few things that uRandombu mentioned that have merits and provide actual value but IMO the bar for the value generated is significantly higher for people to leave their comfortable existing solutions and migrate to a Web3 solution,0,1,1,0,1
Technically Web 3 is the ownership of your data on the internet A lot of projects are being built that aim to actualise this goal through different practical means I wouldnt say any blockchain is useless maybe less relevant in todays world or everyday use However as more blockchains get deployed we can expect to see multiple blockchains striving to achieve the same goal differently Take for instance the bridge you mentioned while alot of projects focuses on bridge development for crosschain transactions a blockchains is focused on the same crosschain transfer but through the use of smartcontract for interoperability solutions So no web3 is not a buzzword but a path and a lot of developers are working on ways to make the web3 goal a reality I am certain many people thought the same of web2 until it became a reality,1,0,0,1,0
Im currently learning about blockchain and Smart Contract Development Today a video popped up on my feed titled Web3 is a scam I just want to ask if learning web3 is worth it,0,1,0,1,0
Exactly Another prime example is the ownership of your identity data onChain Vendible implements this by giving users complete ownership of their identity data onchain This is another way Web3 implements privacy and security features on the internet without any compromise,1,0,0,1,0
There is much more than exchanges bridges and finance Supply chains and Decentralized Identity are just a few examples The important is to take a look at what some projects are doing Im engaging with Polkadot and its parachains Diadata Chainlink and Polygon Just a few options The gaps they are closing like RWA and interoperability can set a new decentralized world Imho its more than just a buzzword,1,0,0,1,0
Absolutely web3 is more than just a buzzword It signifies a shift towards user empowerment and control over their digital identities assets and interactions online While there might be ineffective projects innovative solutions like OREID by AIKON are bridging the gap between the two web2 and web3 enhancing identity management and creating real value in the space,1,0,0,1,0

certainly and i wouldnt dive into web3 hoping to score a well paid job within a short time web3 dev is very much a startup centered industry atm however if someone wants to be a part of maturing web3 tech there is no time like the present,1,0,0,1,0
It does but thats because of what people use it to do which is mainly marketing I like to be specific Web3 is too general and drags a lot with it Progress can be considered when decentralized applicationssolutions start getting mentioned in same vein as their traditional counterparts Like Ocean Market a decentralized data marketplace included in European Commissions report on data sharing platforms alongside other marketplaces That in my eyes was progress At least web3 breaking outside the echo chamber,0,1,0,1,0
As with the emergence of money it may take years to perceive the impact of web3 However with Web 30 people will be able to sell their own data via decentralized data networks while maintaining ownership control Brillionfis methods on this are appealing to me The goal is to address common issues in the web3 world such as creating wallet formation and ensuring the security of private keys improving the usability of web3 applications reevaluating transaction costs and limiting the danger of wallet access loss,1,0,0,1,0
web3 is still on its infancy as the metaverse,0,0,0,1,0
gtTheres a ton of useless blockchain projects that dont bring any value to the table There are many blockchain projects that have contributed to the growth of web3 Personally Im drawn to projects like DIA which bridge the gap between the real world and blockchain DeFi dapps like Uniswap and Quickswap have replaced centralized platforms like Bybit Binance and KuCoin Additionally there are dapps that aim to replace certain aspects of traditional finance The core concept of blockchain revolves around its transparency,1,1,0,1,0
I see the Web3 agenda as decentralization of everything beyond the financial sector A few years back I started following several projects with this narrative Ocean Protocol the first decentralized data marketplace Polkadot the best project for crosschain transfers of data or assets Chainlink a standard oracle framework for bridging the onchain and offchain worlds Weaver Labs cryptotelecom collaboration pioneer and several others I dont think Web3 become useless but I think that the majority of Web3 projects just spilled to other crypto branches AI NFTs Communications etc and Web3 isnt hyped so much anymore but it is still very important for general adoption,1,0,0,1,0
I would say web3 is not just a buzzword looking at a project like Sylo which is a decentralized p2p crypto messenger and communication platform that allows users to transact anonymously as well as communicate without the fear of data leakage unlike other social platforms where users data can be sold The relevance of web3 cannot be neglected anymore as its best is yet to be experienced,1,0,0,1,0
Technically Web3 Blockchain or even AI are just neutrally technical things It depend on how people use it and its just as using a knife Some people might know how to use it right some people use it for criminal or sort of But the knife is still a knife For me I just mainly depend on the technical concept and use cases of these technologies so even when people might use it wrong doesnt mean its not a good thing Like the explanation for these buzzword at Dypto Crypto and Milk Road it supported me to stay on track with the real value behind those words without losing myself in this madness of web3 projects,0,1,0,1,0
Well For inexperienced teams or individuals looking to launch their first project on a web3 platform TonUps userfriendly interface makes it an ideal choice The platform offers stepbystep guidance while setting up tokensales or decentralized applications dApps making it easy for anyone to get involved in the decentralized space,1,0,0,1,0

You have a sad take on things A real world problem is inflation Were just starting to get a taste of that in the US Bitcoin supply cant be arbitrarily inflated Your scenario with your contractor is cute but paints an allornothing argument You keep all your wealth in dollars? Of course you dont Massive amounts of gold? You dont keep it all in your house As for volatility its a function of market cap Bitcoin is about 112th of gold and growing rapidly As the market cap increases volatility decreases Recently Bitcoin ETFs have created the fastest growing traditional finance bridge in the history of the stock market Crime? Dollars are used much more for crime than Bitcoin The only part I agree with is complexity of use Sending assets to places by mistake can be a problem I think well see this addressed in the next generation of wallets especially for smart contract chains All sorts of protections will be in place for lost accounts and or halting or even reversing misspent assets Currently Visa and Mastercard let you instantly spend BTC but you can reverse the charge because theyre acting as a settlementprotection layer Remember just because crypto can be self custody doesnt mean it needs to be in order for people to use it or for that feature to succeed in being a value proposition Just having the option is a giant leap forward and Im glad congress struck down the bill that would prevent self custody to wallets without KYC Id bet most people want their banks to hold some or all of their crypto and thats fine One thing I believe for certain is that the future of asset ownership will be onchaintokenized Im talking digital assets and realworld assets RWAs Getting into Web3 development now is a very smart move At minimum youll learn the underpinnings of how tokens work traits minting features of smart contracts etc Its where computer science meets economics and having more knowledge in that realm can help you in a lot of ways,0,1,0,1,0
As a blockchain developer I would really say no Web3 is not a scam Moreover It is the next evolution of the internet While there may be instances of misuse or fraudulent activities within the Web3 space which is common with each and every technology the overall concept and potential benefits web3 offers are real and promising But at the same it is really important to approach Web3 with caution do thorough research and choose reputable projects and platforms to engage with,1,1,0,1,0
yeah i dont understand the hate blockchain or web3 is getting on this sub creating decentralized databases with the end goal to have a trustless distributed ecosystem is a positive for the world imo my dad has been coding in aws cloud infra for several years and has 20 years of programming experience under his belt a lot of these fortune 500 companies want EVERYTHING pushed to the cloud if aws went down from a bug or a hack or any other unforeseen circumstance a vast portion of our functioning economy would come to a halt bc it is a highly centralized entity servicing 1000s of companies and services web1 read web2 readwrite web3 readwriteown personal data sold to advertisers is googles and facebooks bread and butter for profit data that we give freely for their services tokenization of our personal data is a way to share in that equity and that is just one use case lastly as jobs are already being decommissioned in favor of ai tagging our web2 published data through blockchains allows us to benefit or prevent LLMs from coopting our data without our expressed consent universal basic income is a topic that has come up often if we could benefit monetarily from our data to train these models it has to potential to alleviate the economic shift caused from a postlabor market there are so many legitimate use cases for blockchain tech nfts and tokenization it really makes me wonder why some ppl are so convinced that not even the tech itself has merit independent of scammy pump and dump cryptos,1,0,0,1,0

Absolutely not web3 solves several problems that web2 brings Web3 technologies including blockchain and smart contracts offer a transformative potential for creating decentralized applications dApps that operate on a peertopeer network rather than centralized servers This shift not only enhances security and transparency but also opens up new opportunities for developers and users alike For instance smart contracts enable automatic execution of agreements without the need for intermediaries which can streamline processes across various industries One practical application of Web3 technologies is in the development of decentralized gaming platforms Take slotdappcom for example Its a slot game that leverages the power of smart contracts to ensure fairness and transparency in gaming outcomes By participating in such a platform you can gain firsthand experience with how Web3 can be used to create innovative solutions that tackle traditional challenges in unique ways Learning Web3 development not only equips you with the skills to build such cuttingedge applications but also positions you at the forefront of the next wave of the internets evolution,1,0,0,1,0
Web3 is not a scam All you need to do is researching about it on other platform Research is important when you want to invest or want to join crypto and web3 So far for me Im still study about web3 and now I have joined community neolaunchio  Their platform is trusted you can try check on it As someone who is newbie can try their project since most of it is userfriendly,1,0,0,1,0

Web3 is not a scam but there are scams within the space just like in any emerging technology Here are some reasons why web3 itself is not a scam 1 Innovation Web3 aims to create a decentralized internet enhancing security privacy and user control 2 Real Use Cases There are legitimate applications in DeFi NFTs and decentralized apps dApps 3 Growing Adoption Major companies and developers are investing in and building on web3 technologies However be cautious of fraudulent projects and always do thorough research before investing or participating,1,1,0,1,0
Web3 is not a scam but its important to do your research before investing in or joining a crypto or web3 community Im still learning about web3 and I recently joined the Neolaunch community Their platform is trusted and userfriendly and I think its a good place for newbies to start,1,0,0,1,0
I think smart contracts are very cool Would make accounting auditing and taxes easier At least some aspect of them,1,0,0,1,0
My only concern about web3 is that people are barely knowledgeable about taxes particularly CGT For example when you have a web3 asset like an NFT crypto etc and sell those they get in trouble because of tax implications Not to mention CGT calculations can be confusing to common people If theres no such thing as CGT in Web3 it will be a perfect place in my opinion,0,1,0,0,1
OP web3 is not a scam It has tremendous potential in certain areas Things like decentralized finance allow you to be in total control of your money Eliminating the need for banks and other financial institutions Trust me they the banks are probably the ones spending money on the its a scam advertisement you recieved They have a vested interest in stiffling the growth and adoption of the tech There are other awesome applications aside from finance Things like event ticketing Basically like ticketmaster but eliminating the scalping and fake ticket sales issues There are other really cool applications People saying blanket its a scam arent very knowledgeable on the topic That said its a relatively new sectortech Its the wild west right now There are tons of scammyfakememe web3crypto projects out there You have to be cautious when diving in FOR SURE! Its still in its infancy and I believe the web3 space will continue to grow As it grows the ease of onboardinglearning and overall safety for the common nontechies will get better Its worth learning imo,1,1,0,1,0
Anyone with experience in web3 sports gaming? Curious to see what you think the future of Web3 sports gaming looks like? As well how do you think web3 sports games will incorporate tokenization within its games? Came across this article talking about a web3 sports and entertainment game partnering with two media giants and got me thinking if these partnerships are giving any signals to consumers or if it would be something to look out for?,1,0,0,1,0
Ill be honest web 3 gamefi is on diapers it has a lot of potential yes but rn the majority of web3 games are absurdly bad whoever says a web3 game rn is actually good and fun to play is in massive copium I hope that this changes in the future but rn theres just a lot of greed in the space,0,1,1,0,0
Agreed I feel web3 games only marketing tactic is saying that its a web3 game But where is the value add? What is your experience with specific games? any that stand out?,0,1,0,1,0
I am no expert but I feel its more of creating an environment that compliments certain aspects of web3 ex in the article this superone project adding tokenization within its app simple,0,0,0,1,0
Agreed Although initiatives like Polygon Studios are onboarding triple A devs in aims to change this With that being said web3 gaming is either too predatory too inflationary or games are just bad,0,1,1,0,0
I think the future of sports gaming could be ingame tournaments where you enter using a chosen token that can be exchanged to fiat currency I think users may be able to play a franchise mode where your team builds up real economic value which can be sold Since most likely games will stay centralized I think having some sort of ledger could act more as a risk management for users having a permanent ledger with the transaction history I think gaming will take small bits of web3 such as ownership real world economics and open ledgers,1,0,0,1,0
Explain to me how gaming needs web3 aspects? Isnt crypto is for parties that cant trust one another to do so in a decentralized way? How does this connect w the gaming industry,0,1,0,1,0
With web3 in games you can own the itemscharacters etc in the game and sell or trade them with other players It also makes everything more transparent if items are on the blockchain since you can publicly verify the supply and stuff like that,1,0,0,1,0
Like previously stated I think engagement ownership and transparency would be the three buckets Engagement allowing users to incorporate real world economics into game play Ownership players owning ingame assets to be of monetary value Transparency smart contracts and general blockchain ledgers to ensure users assets ingame earnings are protected from risk of centralization,1,0,0,1,0
People have this aspiration of owning the digital goods they buy For example in Fortnite you spend real money on skins but cant sell them like you would a physical asset because Fortnite doesnt allow it You can see how decentralized ownership of digital goods might look appealing No idea if Web3 is the answer for that but it attempts to provide a solution,1,0,0,1,0
I would probably spend too much buying the best players to build my team up lol I think it has a good spot in web3 though mainly because of the player auctions and markets Ie 500 coins for Lebron James or we Perfect use case for Web3 imo,1,0,0,1,0
Ive had my fair share of mediocracy and fun on Web3 gaming in general I dont really fancy sport games as its not my taste but I think itll have a fair share of adaption when more and more tournaments are behind held on these Web3 games Im still looking for some MMORPG NFT games while I dig into DEXes like AshSwap,1,0,0,1,0
I think a lot of people have always to wanted to one sports or the other professionally but they couldnt of they didnt have the opportunity Some people play some sports so well virtually youll think theyve been playing professionally I love the fact that Web3 sports gaming is giving people chance to express their love for sports by participating in those virtual games Sports to earn is a metaverse ecosystem where people who love sports and push themselves to the limit gather and their efforts in sports are converted into value You can compete with others or contribute to the ecosystem based on that value MEXCglobal just list SAT I think itll be very beneficial to us all,1,0,0,1,0

DeFi today has a massive security UX and scalability problem This prevents devs from building exciting apps and users from navigating the space safely The potential is massive though We already have decentralized money lending Everyone throws money in a pool people borrow money from that pool and pay interest Now we dont need banks for this anymore we provide the service ourselves and earn My advice start with looking into Radix The reason they are light years ahead with their tech UX and devX This gives you an understanding of how DeFi can be done right and also shows you the flaws of other approaches We will see new exciting apps thanks to Radix and other newer protocols like SUI ,1,1,1,0,0
I wouldnt want to call DeFi a global shift but it definitely has got things going for it First and foremost DeFi offers relatively easy acces to all sorts of financial services and products I think a lot of people arent familiar with the landscape which scares them away There are quite some dApps that have built a reputation for themselves over time and that are holding billions of USD in TVL Compared to TradFi products like Funds the AUM is still very low but big money just cant enter DeFi yet because of regulatory uncertainty Also there are legal risksquestions like how do you sue a DAO if something goes wrong with the smart contract Can a DAO go bankrupt? Who takes care of the funds after bankruptcy? How are user funds protected in this case? The legal and regulatory uncertainty are a big barrier atm for institutional investors The good thing is that were moving towards more certainty The SEC suing Binance and Coinbase is actually a good thing because it will help clarify the legal qualification of cryptos I think DeFi has a long way to come but theres way more innovation going on than in TradFi For example Defi is very capital efficint and competitive dApps are fighting over liquidity which is good for liquidity providers Capital is being used efficiently through things like liquid staking UNI V3 and CDPs Asset management protocols are completely different from how TradFi asset management works because they can move funds around much faster taking advantage of yield bearing opportunities Lastly stablecoins offer much faster transfers of money internationally and much much lower fees Try sending money abroad in TradFi its a pain If youre looking for some good cryptoDeFi reading material check out the Coingecko guides Their guides are written by people who know what theyre talking about and offer good insight Also check out DefiLlama it might help you understand the landscape chains protocols TVL etc,0,1,0,1,1
Gaming has come a long way since the late 1970s when arcades reigned supreme and home consoles were little more than a novelty Back then competitive gaming meant vying for the high score on space invaders at the local bowling alley or mall The very idea of Twitch an entire online video sharing platform dedicated to streaming games would have sounded absolutely absurd But things have certainly changed since then The past forty years have brought innumerable shifts to the game industry with the graphical and power disparity between arcade and home console machines shrinking then disappearing altogether During the 2000s and 2010s the advent of the smartphone and mobile games turned video games from a niche hobby targeted at children to one that every demographic enjoyed Today the esports industry is valued at over 1 billion with no signs of slowing down The video game industry as a whole is larger than the film and US sports industries combined But the evolution of video games and competitive gaming isnt over Its really just beginning And the thing that will revolutionize it is Web3 # The Web 30 Revolution So what is Web3? Web3 is what happens when the internet meets recent technological advances like extended reality IOT artificial intelligence and blockchain Its a platform where users will be able to trade and use cryptocurrencies purchase NFTs and experience a version of the web thats uniquely tailored for them In addition it will simplify investing in DAOs and blockchainbased projects via sites like Starterxyz But the important thing to note about Web3 when it comes to competitive gaming is that its technologies are the foundation for GameFi and playtoearn P2E games # The Rise of GameFi Until the development of GameFi competitive gaming and esports followed a similar trajectory to traditional sporting events The best players rose to the top via online local and regional matches eventually competing in major events offering big rewards The only way to earn real money playing video games was by going pro But few people ever got that chance GameFi and the decentralization that undergirds it have upended that traditional model Getting into the competitive gaming scene and earning cash rewards has become accessible for anyone in the world thanks to Web3 and playtoearn gaming And although it is still in its infancy millions of people around the world have already discovered its incredible potential This is the future of competitive gaming amp#x200B # GameFi amp Competitive Gamings Growing Definition While traditional esports and competitive gaming wont disappear the idea of competitive video games will expand to make room for P2E games Axie Infinitys rise has proven that Heres a P2E game thats recorded over 16 billion in total sales and averages nearly 2 million daily users And its shown no sign of slowing down Axie Infinitys players stand at the vanguard of the P2E revolution earning money while battling ingame enemies and each other Its an entirely new way of understanding competitive gaming and its open to almost anyone Even players without the funds to invest themselves can play many P2E games by joining a guild a decentralized organization that makes playable NFTs and other ingame assets available for rent But Axie Infinity is only the first major success story in the growing GameFi market amp#x200B New projects are being developed every day including games in every genre imaginable from JRPGs to racing games There are even a handful of monster breeding and battling startups that are gunning for Axie Infinitys first place position including Starchi a P2E game from the team behind Starterxyz A key difference between Starchi and Axie is that the price of one Starchi is much more affordable allowing many more people to play and earn The goal at Starchi was to take away the barriers and limitations and provide opportunity to a larger group of people overall Starterxyzs experience in the industry has uniquely equipped its team to develop a game that makes the most of GameFis features and benefits Starchi will be just one more example of how competitive gaming has changed since Web3 began taking shape Only time will tell what further evolutions await the gaming industry as technology continues its quick march toward decentralization and personalization,1,0,0,1,0

I am 19 years old just thinking alone at night and I had the question if blockchain is the future of Web 3? I am currently reading Edward Snowdens book Permanent Record and he describes how Google Amazon Facebook Meta etc are all selling our personal information to government agencies such as the CIA and NSA My question is if the government has this kind of control and these companies are profiting off selling user data then why would the government allow for a Web 3 that is decentralized and to where users can own their own data and stay away from centralized banks? That just struck me because I understand people are calling for more regulation on crypto currency after FTX but if thats the case wouldnt users not own their own data which would delegitimize the notion that web 3 is the future If its all about decentralization owning your own data staying away from centralized banks wouldnt the government want to profit off its users data from web 3? Thank you!,0,0,0,1,1
this As a developer can you make money on web3? Most likely Should you make your career as a web3 developer? Its too risky in my opinion Maybe in 10 years when we have proper regulations and the tech is more mature but today is just scam after scam with a couple of real projects,0,1,1,0,1

You are thinking way too high level there are no web3 websites data is extremely expensive you cant store pictures or classic assets Thats why the only real thing there is right now is decentralised exchanges where you can sell or buy coins And the UI of those decentralised exchanges is not decentralised that is just a regular website letting you interact with the smart contract so that its easier to use and more user friendly You cant have lets say a web3 webshop with real items or whatever storing this kind of information on the blockchain is not feasible yet,0,1,1,0,0

You are definitely on target with your assessment but Id like to add that with stocks and their derivatives it actually is a problem Not with creation the Exchange does that in agreement with the Company but the entire ownership chain from there If you are familiar with Float you can clearly see that high volume stocks will trade way more shares than what exists This is why there is a T2 settlement time in the USA It takes 2 days to reconcile all of the systems of record Furthermore with security lending your broker can lend out your shares without permission because you dont actually own them They basically papertrade with you Some people resort to DRS happened a lot with Gamestop but that takes a long time to register your shares If these transactions were recorded on the blockchain there would never be a dispute over ownership or oversold conditions and settlement time would be reduced to the length of time it takes to record to the chain amp#x200B Another area we are working on is Proxy voting If you own shares proof on the blockchain you are eligible for voting If votes are recorded to the chain in a smart contract along with the agenda it then can be a system of record that is independently verifiable and gets rid of several middle men systems that will be unnecessary Once again the participants are reduced to the Exchange The Company and its shareholders Yes there are many technical hurdles to this and yes I am vastly oversimplifying the problem domain so I can type this on mobile but I hope my point still holds value that there are niche realworld cases for blockchain as a business solution,0,1,0,1,1
It sounds interesting especially the voting I dont know the details and you certainly thought more about the topic than me but I still wonder if the same or something similar could be achieved with a centralized public database and an open API that allows authenticated users to manage their possessions The benefit would be that the supervisors of a system like this some state agency I guess could in rare cases fix frauds hacks etc whereas with a completely decentralized system you have no recourse and consequences of a badly written smart contract or a hack could be catastrophic,0,1,0,1,1

Smart contract is a transaction that happens on two ledgers simultaneously Consider you are buying a house from me We have to sign a contract and then you will tranfer me the money And then I will have to give you a corroboration requesttransfer form or some other document that allows you go to some government records office and get the property registered in your name unless I keep saying you sorry bro havent received any in my account yet or I simply disappear right after you transfer me the money in which case good luck tracking me through the courts You could require that I give you the paperwork before you transfer me the money but I wont because I dont trust you So now we need a third party that we both trust However if our bank accounts and the property registry were both implemented in compatible blokchains we could just draw up a smart contract We both sign it and POOF! The money has disappeared from your account and appeared in mine The property has moved from my records to yours Simultenously Without even a theoretical chance of only one side of the deal going through,0,1,0,1,0
Its still a much more risky think to use smart contracts for the average user Just cause smart contracts are run automatically doesnt mean that they cant be exploited if not properly constructed so the end user would likely need to understand smart contract coding pretty well to write and read them Or they could rely on a third party to read and write them but then again they would have to trust a third party in the process I dont see how that third party is any better than trusting a bank which everyone already trusts anyway to do the transactions Or in a real estate agency to safely execute the contract And its likely a real estate agency or agent would already be involved anyway because they would be necessary to visit the house or to do due diligence And like the scenario of buying a house and the person just disappearing with the money is not common Buying a house is not buying a meal its something most people do once in their lifetime and of course its a very important process There are already safeguards for the seller to simply not say I didnt received the money And the seller cant be that difficult to track through the courts since they already own a piece of land in the place the court has jurisdictions Sure it will be a hassle to go to the courts but it would a be a much bigger problem if the smart contract somehow got exploited and then the buyer could end up without a house and without money and nowhere to appeal,0,1,0,0,1

Im no expert on this stuff but there are some obvious advantages over a paper contract in that a smart contract is executable and hence not subject to the vaguaries of interpretation that lead to disputes in contract written in English Also they execute automatically once preconditions are satisfied so theres no issue with needing to enforce things For example with an escrow arrangement encoded as a smart contract the money is transferred automatically in exactly the circumstances that this should happen Typically in real world escrow arrangements you pay someone fees for this service and in theory have have some risk on the creditworthiness reliability and honesty of that entity but those things are not really an issue with a smart contract,1,0,0,1,0
The smart contract can still be exploited though They are coded in and as such there are vulnerability as any program It takes some level of skill to build a smart contract without vulnerabilities,0,1,0,0,1
Gotcha that makes sense I was also just thinking about the specifics of the contract because they would be coded so technically you would need some sort of physical contract for someone to review the specifics otherwise everyone would have to read the code which would be confusing Your use case example makes sense to me though in that it could execute the contract quicker and safer So I guess physical contract for review smart contract for execution,0,0,0,1,0
I think the idea is that you dont need the physical contract at all the smart contract encodes everything thats needed and can be inspected by all parties before committing to it I take your point about people not being able to understand code but I suppose its a lot like people not really understanding legal contracts and paying lawyers to advise them I guess the idea would be that there would be well established and widely used contracts for specific kinds of transactions All of this probably works fine when everything involved is onchain but becomes tricky when real world objects are involved If youre selling your house to me theres no onchain legallyenforceable representation of ownership of the house But you could imagine a scenario where a smart contract was able to consult an authoritative api giving information about owners of land or indeed that there were in fact NFTs that represent an enforceable interest in land Keep in mind that Im not at all expert in this field just thinking out loud about how I imagine its suppose to work,0,1,0,1,0

gt if blockchain is the future of Web 3? No gt I am currently reading Edward Snowdens book Permanent Record and he describes how Google Amazon Facebook Meta etc are all selling our personal information to government agencies such as the CIA and NSA And? Its not like those services are mandatory? Not to mention its easy enough with a bit of time and effort to remain mostly anonymous gt My question is if the government has this kind of control and these companies are profiting off selling user data then why would the government allow for a Web 3 that is decentralized and to where users can own their own data and stay away from centralized banks? Means you have a fundamental misunderstanding about how the internet operates For example take something less recent without all the buzzword shenanigans Torrenting How does the government allow piracy to exist despite all the economic losses it causes? The fact of the matter is they get very little say to begin with Yes they can take down tracker sites but take the case of piratebay within about a week of the takedown there were about half a dozen copycats that popped up in its place Govnt is on the losing side of whackamole With that in mind switch gears to web3 which isnt really anything special it uses the same protocols and the same infrastructure as the internet does currently For starters all proofofwork currency bitcoin etc will never reach the mainstream for the simple fact performance is rubbish and it wastes too much energy As soon as carbon trading takes off itll die and fade into obsolescence Regarding other types of DeFi proofofstake itll end up being a digitized version of what we have already ie minting authorities treasury banks Even tho it has the potential to be decentralized at the architecture level its still going to trend towards centralization Same way linux kernel dev via git is decentralized but theres probably only a few main repos branches people actually watch use out of hundreds or thousands Those minting companies equivalent of banks now will be the gateway to people and businesses IRL who dont want to have to manage other aspects around their finances eg wallet security transfers etc The one and only difference between that and what we have now with fiat Its much easier to become a minting authority via Defi so long as you have the startup capital hardware capacity And so while funds will be more decentralized in terms of institutional funding From the perspective of the individual consumer basically nothing will change And if theres no direct benefit to them then theres no reason to change and it will happen very very slowly without some other kind of catalyst Even if you took the ideal case that all consumers everywhere want to jump to DeFi That doesnt mean producers manufacturers will,0,1,0,0,1
A few years ago I thought there was decent potential for web 3 other than crypto which Ive given up on for much longer like NFTs DAOs smart contracts DeFi in general Recently Ive just done a full 180 on it though People keep trying to compare it to the early internet and how it took decades to take off fully for consumer usage but that is a terrible comparison The internet took a while to take off because technology hadnt caught up yet it took minutes to load simple pages it was prohibitively expensive Web 3 products are completely viable right now there are no technological gaps that people are missing its completely fine for end users the demand isnt there Even before the consumer internet took off governments and large institutions had their own networks or used large networks to share data Theres nothing comparable right now in the web 3 world At the end of the day web 3 development is harder because theres extra layers and the demand doesnt justify it If you dont have solid property rights in place commerce cannot function The whole selling point of web 3 is decentralization but that just doesnt appeal to the average person If they cant trust authorities and dont have the property rights in place to have the confidence to use a product then they arent going to look to alternate solutions that are more cumbersome theyre going to try and establish a convenient system that does allow for trust Theres money to be made in the boom speculation stage but its a gamble Its in a downturn now I do expect at least one other boom stage most likely in a few years when inflation is stabilized interest rates are lowered infusion of money supply happens but to me its just a dead end,0,1,1,0,1
All cryptocurrency products are a solution in search of a problem with the possible exception of bitcoin in my opinion Let me explain The only real innovation cryptocurrency brought was a implementation for a distributed public and owner free database that is resistant to manipulation or spamming by bad actors Before bitcoin all money was in someones custody if your money wasnt in your physical possession it was in a bank somewhere and therefore the way the money behaves is subject to regulation Then comes along bitcoin an open source distributed network for holding onto electronic money that was not in a bank And the blockchains design meant that nobody controlled it and it was basically impossible to turn off Because there was no bank to hit with regulations when it came to bitcoin how it worked couldnt be controlled And to deny the public access to this utility would be against free speech and free trade So governments around the world basically had no choice but to accept its existence Bitcoin solved a problem and that problem is electronic money controlled entirely by the end user with no third party working as a custodian That is it It didnt fix anything wrong with the web it didnt allow people to communicate when they otherwise were previously unable to communicate it solves no other purpose that isnt already handled better by existing technology Beyond bitcoin we have had a whole pile of web3 innovations alternative blockchain protocols NFT style gambling etc Every one of these new revolutionary ideas is put together by a public entity like a company which is subject to regulations and in some ways becomes a custodian for your money which must be trusted to use the service This defeats the only real innovation that Bitcoin introduced in the first place that there was no central authority behind Bitcoin And frankly every one of these new innovations has been done better with some other technology or traditional company on web For these reasons I think all of cryptocurrency is a big blur of people with solutions in search of a problem Nobody really needs cryptocurrency except for one reason to have a privately held digital store of value Id therefore ignore all of whatever web3 is as a developer and focus your energy into other places,0,1,0,0,1

Smart contract developer here Web3 will not revolutionize the world and solve all the data ownership problems today but without a doubt it opens the possibility for new types of apps with new types of power structures and broad ranges of decentralization Very few web3 apps are fully decentralized today but as this new tech stack matures further decentralization becomes easier to accomplish Many will say that its all bullshit and web3 is useless crap but its far to early to come to any definitive conclusions like that The truth is web3 tech stacks are incredibly immature and this new paradigm of decentralized app development has a long way to go but really do have potential to disrupt data ownership economies that exist today As a web3 dev I can deploy applications on a blockchain with built in payment channels data storage and backend hosting smart contracts in this case encapsulates all of these services After deploying my dApp I never have to worry about maintenance or keeping my dApp online I think this alone is a pretty cool effect of having access to blockchains and I find them very fun to develop on So to answer your question Web3 is absolutely legit but has a long way to go and decades of maturing before it can truly live up to its promises,1,1,0,1,0

Remove Web 3 from the conversation the point of crypto is freedom and encryption before Bitcoin and all these other solutions popped up has been massive for modern security The standards adopted have made everyone infinitely safer When we talk about being safe in the context of our own government and even other governments with massive intelligence operations people have this weird hangup though Tor already exists I2P already exists Monero is already massively used Bitcoin tumblers have been used for a long time now How about torrenting? Veracrypt? TLS We already HAVE the technology to do these things theyre just not as secure and accessible to the general populace through mainstream solutions amp theyre not bundled into a package well enough It is all going to become just as valuable to protect as it is to sell and its becoming increasingly clear that the protection of data has fallen behind the harvesting and manipulation of it If you are an American Apple will probably always not be 100 safe if you want protection against your own government but they do have incentive to make them secure against others amp are capable of doing so as they already do it through contracting with the federal government Id be surprised if Apple was not the company who began to view privacy this way Companies are already starting to show ads to people who are paying for their services and that is already too mind bending for most to understand This is the way it is going to be though It is a war for your information and for your eyes This idea and technology at the very least of a decentralized network setup in different configurations and level of accepted oversight on the end of the creators community and I suppose investors is going to branch into more commonly accepted stuff that will pervert the ideology a bit but it will be more supported in the name of not supporting child molesters and drug dealers peoples favorite excuse to spy on you and take your rights away I think even if you hate cryptocurrency the best example of how ubiquitous Web3 can be is Monero Its relationship in a regulatory sense its use as a utility the fact that it sacrifices several things to provide what it does and runs into scaling issues If you look at it its community and then eyeball the communities around Bitcoin it can be a little eye opening Its fighting a battle that others in the same space arent necessarily even trying to strive for I think Bitcoin being the largest one in the space holding 50 over all the others for so long was generally bad for optics because its a bloated wasteful very transparent project Again though dont think about the government in their relationship to this technology The very point of it and some much less robust tech before it was to preserve liberty Is Web3 legit? Nah the majority of what is going on is built off the mania amp rush that literally comes from Bitcoin which is very archaic and somehow managed to soak a trillion dollars literally in All of the real developers in the space are being built right now And youre 19 So I mean thats exciting and people here should be encouraging this curiosity From a development standpoint there is nothing wrong with it people here are ideologically in the past and seem not to care how much their life is being pried into amp how these companies with huge profit incentives social engineer their behavior like theyre pavlovs dog In the context of Twitter especially recently isnt it an interesting thought how this might be really impactful in the future and give people some control back in their lives and with their data? I think it is and I think weve gotten to the point with data where it is so perverted that people are starting to notice amp complain They have already regulated crypto in NY amp several states thanks to the fine fellas at Coinbase and FTX They will try to regulate it and harm it further so its something to think about if you get into further My recommendation isnt that you should go be a freedom fighter either its just that people who wont get into Web3 or smart contracts because you have these hangups just stop Give yourself a chance I would also caution you to accept in your heart that any semicentralized semiregulated type projects especially ones that are even cousins of this while at the same time encourage developing in them if its an interest of yours Look at OrbitDB and see if you like that go further and try to follow Web3 as the leaders actually show themselves because even the current solutions arent true to life by I guess learning Solidity and so on Some of this a little over the top and paranoid sounding for the record but I hope its a change of pace lol,0,1,0,1,1

Blockchains NFTs and the such have some great use cases that I can see happening in the future but that is only if those working on the projects that actually have good use cases can get the proper supports and funding which is currently getting used up by those pushing scams and hype or pushing things like trading and algorithms Personally I see alot of utility in both NFTs and blockchains and DLT like Hedera but again bad actors have taken up the space and ruin it for those who have good ideas to help the world around them A big thing to also note that is the elephant in the room is that these decentralized blockchains are actually still centralized because there is not enough servers and too many people with large influences in how the fluctuations on the price movements happenlook at the whales Personally I see the future of blockchains as being more as a technology than as the future of the web Interoperability is definitely an issue and scams are a big issue but I do see potential in things like using Ethereum Push Protocol Notificationspreviously it was ETHEREUM PUSH NOTIFICATION SERVICE as a messaging system or using the InterPlanetary File Storage SystemIPFS to back up data and combat censorship especially with things like books infind it especially interesting to see projects like PageDAO trying to work on stuff like that its those types of projects that I see potential in long term as they are trying to solve issues One problem I tried to solve was using POAP NFTs Proof of Attendance Protocal to scale readers of books in a book club If i could find a way to track how many pages are read in a digital book that would solve a huge scaling issue the publishing industry has where publishers buy ebooks and create fake sales propping up their books on best seller lists These are issues that blockchains and other Web3 technology can potentially help with but these are also problems that have been around for a very long time and were why things like the internet archive was created So my thoughts on web3 is very mixed because the hype from the bad actors is taking away the potential solutions to problems that the good actors are trying to solve Hackathons are a great thing but if you cant afford to attend one are on a team by yourself or just are not great at marketing your projects and creating slides then they are pretty much useless to a person Its really a contradictory space as the web3 community talks alot about solving the problems created during web1 and web2 yet they are just following the same path and taking the same approach with web3 thus making it a historical cycle It will be interesting to watch it play out and hopefully the bad actors will wash away and the good folks will get noticed before they become so discouraged or deep in a hole that they get pushed out,0,1,1,1,1
Cut through the fluff and youll discover that the primary innovation of Web3 blockchain is Decentralized Consensus For the longest time we needed centralized authorities because there was no good way to coordinate a distributed system without some centrality for the consensus algorithm When the Bitcoin paper was introduced that all changed Instead of using a centralized server to select nodes to share their transactions Bitcoin and most blockchains select nodes randomly by relying on the natural laws of statistics instead of a server The probability that a node gets selected increases based on how much theyve contributed to the network In the original paper the more work a node does trying to solve a challenging puzzle the more likely it is the node will solve it and be selected This is called proof of work Once selected they share their work and its validated and rebroadcast by all listening nodes Because multiple nodes can be selected at once the network always trusts the chain with the most selections because its harder to fake After initial publication a lot of work went into proving statistically when the network would be safe compromised The proportion of stake attributed to honest nodes being critical Over time the arbiter changed from proof of work to proof of stake financial contribution alone but the fundamental idea of selecting a node randomly based on its contribution is the same Anything else you hear about Web3 blockchain is an implication of decentralized consensus,1,0,0,1,0
A good example of how Web3 is actually beneficial is when Hic Et Nunc an experimental art website with tons of users was randomly shut down by its owner and the next day someone forked the repo and brought it back to life This was only possible because all of the art users etc were on the blockchain and not some centralized database that the website owned This also means other websites can crop up and use the same data in different ways which leads to really interesting iterative uses,1,0,0,1,0
The concept is sound look at git but current implementations of web3 solutions arent An interesting project you should learn about is Quant The company designed an API that allows developers to process transactions on different blockchains This allows quant to centralise and record all data id imagine governments would buy into this idea but it completely undermines the idea of decentralisation,0,1,0,1,1
gtMy question is if the government has this kind of control and these companies are profiting off selling user data then why would the government allow for a Web 3 that is decentralized and to where users can own their own data and stay away from centralized banks?

You guys are haters lol Just because the market is driven by speculation doesnt mean there cant be a symbiotic relationship between the speculators and with real tech and good projects The same can be said for traditional stocks There will always be speculators but tokenizing projects can add extra utility to what traditional shares and company structure Traditional company structures are being reimagined by allowing token holders to vote for the direction a project moves in based on number of owned tokens or any other programmatic mechanism I find an interesting example to be when a project uses inflation in their token to pay new contributors at the expense of passive token holders What I love is the playful Darwinistic nature of tokenomics Projects with revolutionary ideas around compensation and voting will survive and others will fail Anyway if you are interested I would highly recommend eth globals hackathons After that get in discord and dm blockchain project s you meet at the hackathons for small gigs You will be paid in tokens lol,1,1,0,1,0
For some context one of my clients is big into block chains and the crypto space and mentioned the concept of web3 in one of the usual client meetings we had Ive done my own research into it and still on the fence about the adoption of Web 30 will it really actually happen? The concept is interesting still investigating but it sounds like making the data owned by the user and data is stored on the blockchain? Its hard to find a clear idea of what it really is Gemini talks about an overarching AI to run everything like some sort of god while the web3 foundation talks about the data ownership and decentralisation of it all The issue I have is uptake of the entire concept if it is taking data away and making it owned by the users big boys such as Facebook and google most likely wont incorporate it where would their profits be in a world where they dont own and control your data Both being so engrained into most businesses that I deal with And then with data itself unless they make an easy way to transition between old ways of storing data such as MySQL why would anyone rebuild their existing programs to suit such a niche market? I know it may be adopted overtime but its such a radical change and ask and disrupts the already functioning and evolving standards and practices we use Thats if Im actually understanding the whole thing correctly I might be entirely wrong about my assumptions so please do correct me if i am What are all your thoughts?,0,1,0,1,1
gt Is Web 3 legit Yes its a real movement And its fairly cool at the core In my opinion the core tenet of web3 is decentralization Recently Mastodon got fairly popular Its a social network where but you dont have to sign up with a central authority You can set up your own server or join anyone elses server and interact with everyone much like in the email system you can have interact with everyone on other servers But it offers far wider feature set than email Its more like twitter And then there are other amazingly cool solutions like apps that have no server and even databases without a server gt Is blockchain the future of Web 3? We dont know Blokchain is a solid way to ensure eventual consistency Many of the web3 solutions are built on Ethereum network But there are other powerful solutions like Gun DB that accomplishes great decentralized things without any blockchains gt If the government has this control and companies are profiting off of selling user data then why would the government allow for a Web 3 that is decentralized? Well what can they do? Announce that products like Gun DB are outlawed? What about emails? Are they also forbidden? gt I understand people are calling for more regulation on crypto currency after FTX? Unfourtunately theres a great deal of scam around some of these technologies I assume thats because they involve money But crypto currencies are not a necessary component of web3,1,0,0,1,1
melkaneas opinion on this subject hope you enjoy my weird writing style its a fact we live in globalized mega system desperately looking for solutions to its own problems web 3 is the first time the system tries to get feedback from its users! all these corporate giants are the old school add revenue model types amp have a real hard time implementing new models of revenue as they lack the technology! its borderlines slavery in current times you have to advertise products by creating content amp claim some kind of revenue many revenue models exist amp tipes vary from corps to govs your mentioned platforms cant allow for certain content due to payment providers amp the fact no one is responsible for their own content long legal machining needs to be done if something goes wrong amp you earn shitons of cash with content that is ilegal in a country but not in anther! how to earn from shared content whitout using adds? SOON if web 3 provides anonymity till i decide to share it then i could also earn respectively govs like this idea cus then all transactions are taxable i think they actually want web 3 to work! they dont care who pays just that the payment was successful! ID as another issue who verifies your human existance amp grants you all human rights? how about your responsibilities? govs do that they verify your data to prove other govs you are real! What if something is ilegal lets say gay in quatar depicting 2 humans instagraming their kiss at the stadium many closeted lgbt in quatar will want to enjoy the content amp will find a way to watch it! vpns amp geoblocking is bullshit if your personal data is stored amp verified then you are also in your right to sell it earnings protected by laws as you sell your basic lifestyle content! sounds like slavery with extra steps cus it is till you are free to protect your privacy! ################################################################## the next section is 18 cus ima amateur myself if its ilegal there is a reason amp for the same reason people will always want it! its atractive cus its unique amp breaks the norms! legal age age of consent in austria is 14 if the oldest is 18 after 18 legal actions are enforced if needed! how do you verify a horny teenager not to upload their own content?? facebook has serious issues here! pronhub doesnt! only gov ID verified users can publish content on pornhub then each piece is encoded scanned amp verified before publishing! in my experience amateur nsfw content which has this verification is earning well in the industry all of it is legal content created by real humans having relationships as a adult professional model amp star you own your own content amp lease it to 3rd parties like PH to make a profit! ph pays out in crypto the nsfw token cummies from cumrocket for instance creates nfts out of nsfw the real truth is that all humans want wealth amp are inherently greedy! issue is no one has created the perfect tech where all your content can be safely stored amp registered No one want the responsibility of policing our most Precious content the content is technically ilegal law suits amp punishments could be enforced but who does it? amp where in austria one has all civil rights amp insurances as lgbt the pic could be used publicly by media to sell a news story how do you handle as government or corporations? to finish the cake off 6 why web 3 is actually what the goverments want everyone acountable for themselves while enjoing the protections amp insurances the system provides its your life! all of it ever piece of digital content you have created is your own property amp must be protected by law you can trace amp collect every user interaction the blockchain has made with your content this means you are also able to monetize it thanks for taking the time melkanea,0,1,0,1,1

In my opinion The crypto crash was not caused by lack of regulation it was caused by regulation Still hard to exchange crypto for currency at least in my country still hard to use crypto AS currency Its just a stock with no intrinsic value When bankers and popiliticans are asking for increased regulation what they mean is they want to have centralized control to manipulate the currency extract value from it without even needing to tax peoplebusinesses but also have things like taxes and transaction fees levied and enforced by blockchain Decentralization and regulation are in my opinion opposites,0,1,1,0,1

Im just here to drop a few words Blockchain has solved some levels of financial dependency over the traditional finance sector with low interest rates for savings and lending through DeFi I will agree though that most high yield farms actually comes from initial capital from the project founders but even the low ones still beat general tradfi rates 13 is already high Next is about the latter Of course its another thing to suck up to market demand and big mover will but thats because we allow it Ofc I dont agree that one could just apply blockchain to everything because they can Cloud still wins as long as its providers are regulated well through its democratic jurisdiction and maybe economic incentive which is why the sites we go to and the files we save are still up and kicking edit btw i would like to add that the future should be one that gives more options rather than forcing people to one avenue so that means appending web30 and defi alongside web20 and cefitradfi with of course proper democracy,1,0,0,1,0

I think this entire thread is missing the point of Web3 Web3 is more about moving assets into the digital age and allowing true digital ownership of something People saying that big tech wont let it happen might be right but what about a new start up utilizing crypto that allows someone to truly own the content they produce? How does big tech compete with that without adopting it? Is the demand there? I dont know but crypto enthusiasts seem to value that Yet to be seen if it valuable to the general public Smart contracts allows code enforceable contracts Blockchain allows ownership of digital assets This is very game changing in the word of finance One example I will use that people may be able to wrap their heads around is gaming assets You may work for items in a WoW game put considerable time and effort into it but if Blizzard decides to ban your account for some arbitrary reason then you have no way to get your items back You dont own them Blockchain allows you to actually truly own these items Blizzard cant take them away from you There are even assets on blockchain that could be used in many different games They are game agnostic Before you say that this wouldnt gain popularity it already has These games are very basic though and that fun but it is an exciting space with a lot of development constantly TLDR Blockchain is not trying to replace MySQL It is trying to allow for the digital ownership of all digital assets removing counterparty risk Take that however you may,1,0,0,1,0

But I guess the part Im missing is where does web3 and blockchain fit into this specifically? Diablo tried it with the auction house and other MMOs like Final Fantasy XIV let players buy and trade assets acquiredcraftedpurchased in game You could do the same thing with limited edition gear with current technology if you wanted Even if we are writing ownership on an immutable ledger I dont really see what real practical benefit that provides for proof of ownership insofar as my ability to buy and trade digital assets At some point an API or other piece of software has to interact with it and then anything can happen were trusting the software to read the ledger correctly,0,1,0,1,0
Unfortunately this artificial concept of digital ownership that cant be taken away is just a dream A realworld example of this is Axie Infinity Its an NFTbased game but the devs have the power to ban axies NFTs if they deem youve violated their terms of service Banned axies are worthless Decentralization while possible will always be controlled by very centralized companies,0,1,0,0,1

I concur The philosophy of what is currently dubbed Web3 which has shifted from the semantic web projection is currently one of decentralization of web data and services Blockchain is just a very hyped up technology used for facilitating the vision of web3 and its unnecessarily considered as the central technology when decentralization can be accomplished in other ways some already developed but dont get as much press like IPFS and others not yet invented to solve current roadblocks Im neither a believer that web3 is the next revolution and going to dominate the majority of near future web infrastructure the answer to that is really whether the current definition and parameters of web3 is whether it facilitates a new wave of replacement of industry and commerce much as web2 ala brickandmortars being phased out by ecommerce and the adoption of new ways of doing things that dominate out lives ala Facebook As for my opinion of what that next wave will include will not just be blockchain tech which i agree is overhyped because its making money and pushing news about it profits those invested in it but decentralization as well as AI and what can be coined web25 with push notifications and streaming data services I see search engines being replaced by personalized AI agents streaming recommendations ideas and ads preemptively doing searches for us and pushing us relevant results etc my two cents I,0,1,0,1,0
Practically what does that look like establishing trust without trust Because personally I feel much more secure using a credit card knowing I can do a chargeback if theres any fraud or VisaMC will cover the cost in most fraud cases And we know for a fact companies are scared to lose VisaMC its like having the 800lb gorilla on the consumer side Whereas with any crypto I need to be 100 sure I trust the other person because I have no recourse if I get scammed And I as in 99 of consumers really dont care about VisaMC losing money thats their problem In what situation is this trust without trust useful for me?,0,1,0,0,1
Ok I see what you mean Im no fan really of big banks or credit cards Ive had a bank close my account because of bitcoin transactions which is BS But your example with paying with card its pretty rare to pay for something and they add 3 if you pay with credit card They charge the 2 processing fees to the merchant The price is the same price whether you pay by credit debit or cash or crypto for that matter These kind of regulations and barriers go both ways we always want less regulations until something happens and we wish there were some regulations in place Like using a crypto exchange is cool until something happens and you have no recourse because its not a regulated exchange And Im talking for the perspective of most consumers People dont really care that much about these issues until they are affected by them Just like weve seen people dont actually care abut Privacy its been what a decade since Snowden exposed how the NSA is spying on us all? 95 of people forgot after 3 months Like in reality how much of a problem are mutable public records? Where do you see actual applications for these? Im guessing these would be dapps? I have a hard seeing it as a huge revolution and not something useful in certain niches like NFTs or intl money transfers maybe micro transactions Whereas with web 10 and web 20 the ideas seemed to come naturally You could connect with people anywhere share things stream etc Things that were almost impossible or very difficult before,0,1,0,1,1

In Korea and Mongolia two fintech payment solutions are using the Terra chain to settle their transactions This has led users to avail of discounts more because of the cheaper fees on the Terra chain compared to legacy tradfi The users of said solutions MemePay and Chai Pay need not know theyre using blockchain The Terra chain or at least the arrangement of a delegated proofofstake as consensus allows ordinary people or anyone to validate or delegate to a validator to earn the transaction fees while maintain the validity of the transactions on the chain You dont need to be a big company or own a share of a financial company which probably has a lot of red tape to do to be a play a role in the system and earn money for it Btw you said something about privacy but it actually has nothing to do with it since blockchains are usually transparent But generally no one would know you own a certain wallet address unless you said so Its more about borderless finance and a financial system that anyone could be the settler or the bank instead of the institutions Btw centralized crypto exchanges arent blockchain anymore Theyre just centralized databases that hold crypto assets for you Decentralized exchanges are the ones that never have custody of your assets provided that the smart contract says so I needed to emphasize that because interacting with bad smart contracts are literally just giving a scammer your money As long as the smart contract and audits guarantee that no other user could get your funds then practically its safe unless the said chain is compromised which is unlikely depending per chain Check stats on how varied and decentralized the validators are Im not claiming that blockchain is the onestop solution out there In the end were trusting humans but at least the trust is distributed rather than concentrated which in theory should lessen the chance of management compromise I would agree that the future is a multimodal one and not necessarily a defi or web3 one Cefi and tradfi would still play an important role in society as well as web2 Whats required of us all no matter what system would always be integrity,1,0,0,1,0

I recently worked on a project that used selfsovereign identity backed by blockchain and the role of the blockchain is not actually to hold data but to hold information that makes the data validatable in a distributed system For instance imagine that a user pays for a subscription to your service Normally you would store that subscription on your backend because you want to make sure that the data isnt changed and stays valid What blockchain allows you to do using mechanisms such as zero knowledge proofs is to allow the client to store that data in a wallet and for anyone who receives it to verify its validity in a complete independent manner It also doesnt mean that the entity receiving your data wouldnt be able to save it and hold it if they wanted to which means that this doesnt do much of anything to stop big companies from mining data There are also approaches to selfsovereign identity that dont use blockchain at all notably Solid pods by Sir Tim BernersLee,0,1,0,1,0

Its not really areas Like by areas Im thinking industries etc But blockchain is most effective when the data is transactional It is effective where there are multiple parties who are not known or trusted by each other It is effective where transparency and auditability are important If those requirements dont exist then blockchain probably doesnt convey a benefit That is speaking of public blockchains at least Private blockchains can still benefit if there are multiple known parties sharing a source of truth,0,1,0,1,0
The fiasco with Robinhood shutting down during the GameStop craze is a pretty solid case for decentralized finance Turning social media on its head is also a good case as someone else pointed out Adoption seams virtually nonexistent and volatility is a major hurdle to overcome if anyone is going to feel confident enough to really go all in however Its all just massive speculation still The echo chamber is real I say this as someone that still hopes blockchain can eventually deliver on all the pie in the sky theory,0,1,1,0,1
In my opinion you should think about it critically watching what is actually valid and what is not A lot of people where reluctant even about the Mobile App market but we know what happened and now is an oversaturated market Dont ignore the space because there are a lot of nontech people that are there just for the money The technology behind it is very interesting,0,1,0,1,0
Web20 itself decentralized a lot of things phone tv radio media mail then central orgs went from resistance to adoption But that biz model anchored on personal data which many of us dont like but live with it cos there is so much upside in that tradeoff Now if something comes along and offered a chance at taking control back of that data I wud gladly switch Blockchain doesnt seem to be that technology that can completely upend 20 but can reclaim some pieces away from the central orgs Which IMO is an essential counter balance to the googles of the world,1,1,0,1,0
I totally forgot about the payment of data model with Web 30 I did read about it I assume it would mean every change you make to your account or data you would have to pay for it to be changed Upvoting something on reddit if it used Web 30 would cost actual money Correct me if Im wrong,0,1,0,0,1
I dont think it will take over the internet but there are surely use cases where blockchain has advantages over traditional database servers It has its niche but having open data in an immutable timetable where theres no concern of the data server going down is valuable It wont take over the internet but I can see companies implementing their own semicentralized blockchains where nodes are controlled by owner to handle things like supply chain see what VET has been doing in China Theres certainly still issues around blockchain and projects are still falling to scams and schemes but I have a feeling adoption is around the corner for a large number of companies that can see the benefits of having their data in such an environment Ethereum in particular is proving itself to be quite a robust system and its Developer Foundation has some interesting plans for its future,1,1,0,1,0
From my perspective it all comes down to ownership Owning your personal data your own finances your own gaming assets and where YOU as a customer decide to provide that data This means that businesses that rely heavily on customer data can have a more personal relationship with their customers since users will be able choose to share their data in exchange for a service in a more meaningful way You can make the argument that this is already the case but imagine a web in which we dont need forms anymore since a wallet would hold all the information you are willing to let go with If you tie that with the fact that you can make monetary transactions sign documents and trade assets it makes sense to just have a system that eases this process for web developers At the end of the day this isnt a replacement but an upgrade the same way we switched from polling to websockets or usernamepassword to social auth this is just another iteration that will spur new business ideas thanks to the benefits it provides Saying its a scam or a solution looking for a problem is like saying tables are better than divs back in the day yeah some people will abuse it but at the end of the day its about the user if it makes their life easier better or more performant then theyll adopt it,1,0,0,1,0

Hi Everyone tldr Currently working in Web3 vertical and would love to hear everyones views and outlooks on Web3 product and development Im currently working as a Product Manager for a Web3 development consulting company I left a fortune 100 to join this venture which was started by a CTO I worked under on a build a few years ago I was at my end with the corporate position that was basically just waterfall management with people pretending to be SAFe One of the directors would scream at people on calls all the time though never at me but it was my I need to get out of here moment Anyways I put my two weeks in without a job lined up haha thats how bad I needed to get out of there So I got a job offer relatively quickly to lead a major systems integration build at Penta Group and called my old CTO for a reference after getting my verbal offer He took the opportunity to poach me to work for him instead He sold me the vision I loved working with him in the past and he promised me that I would have say and ownership of all product decisions So I took the leap of faith and its been quite the ride Hes a great guy with alot of knowledge but he lacks basic business knowledge In addition to my PM work Ive been leading marketing amp design efforts for the company and I help manage the sales strategies I worked in sales years prior We have completed some very impressive builds but it seems that Web3 is having trouble gaining traction in the space I want to hear from you all about your thoughts on Web3 and what you think its future will look like,1,0,0,1,0
The problem with Web3 is it relies on a network of individual parties to maintain it IE to support the consensus underlying it This means these parties have to be incentivised in some way to support it Crypto tokens provide this mechanism but unless they are constantly increasing in value and the cost to Web3 users is constantly rising there is not enough incentive for these parties to participate So it is inherently unstable deflationary I cant see what mechanism would make it a stable ecosystem at this point so I wouldnt trust it as a space to start a company,0,1,0,0,1
I keep hearing people say it doesnt solve any problems but it does Decentralized userowned data that isnt controlled mined and sold for profit by powerful entities that dont share a dime with the users Also blockchain ledgers are extremely transparent and visible which can discourage unlawful behaviors that tend to happen in the current environment Also distributed ownership among users not just big entities have the control and power I see all of these as great steps and answers to problems that are in the current environment Honestly I feel that web3 gets shit for the same reason crypto does because its the last thing the big and powerful organizations want implemented because they wouldnt be able to manipulate and control it It seems to be all about control for them so its in their best interest to make sure Web3 keeps getting discouraged and spreading the message that it provides zero value These are lies,1,1,1,0,0

So I have been looking into web 3 for quite a while and I get the feeling that I am missing something I get that its basically a decentralised web where You own your data You get to authenticate everywhere with your wallet Users can get paid for ad revenue instead of companies like GoogleFacebook Everything is transparent and secure But here is my question What reallife additional use cases does web3 offer that web2 just cant? I understand that the points that I mentioned are all great but from a practical point of view what kind of functionality can you get out of web3 that you cant get out of web2?,0,1,0,1,0
I think the biggest advantage is peer to peer networks there is no middle man or central server that connects everything,1,0,0,1,0

So its up to the users to maintain and host the network?,0,0,0,1,0
Just want to point out that nobody has answered OPs questions so far apart from uMaleficentPlankton OP asked for real web3 use cases Everyone is reiterating the concepts but giving no real examples of the utility I wish I could provide an answer but Im also where OP is at I understand how decentralization can completely change the game in concept but its very hard to find projects that are live and demonstrating the value at this stage DAOs and NFTs are the best the closest thing Ive seen but I feel like they only scratch the surface and Id love to understand web3 more Perhaps Im not looking in the right places?,0,1,0,1,0
Defi? If you consider that to fall under the banner of web3 then yeah The gist of it is programmable money Anyone can wake up one day and money do whatever they want Eg tokenized stocks sports betting high yield saving AMMs loans Without restriction on location too Examples mirror augur anchor Uniswap Aave You cant just open up a stock exchange or betting agency as a random person currently Too much red tape And if you managed to it wont serve the whole world And it wont be composable either Composability is what I think is the game changer If we reach a stage where most financial instruments are composable Its essentially an internet of money This stuff is relatively new so you wont see the full extent of that now,1,0,0,1,0
Web3 consists of several concepts DAOs DeFi NFTs Selfsoverign identity DAOs and DeFi already have good use cases and dont really need further explanation Theyre also not what OP is asking about OP is asking more about the NFT and identity part The thing about NFTs is that theyre just numbers stored on ledgers Theyre typically very small to save space and dont store the actual customer data The ledgers themselves only store transactions for those NFTs Its up to platforms to determine how theyre actually interpreted Your web3 avatar on one platform might look very different than your avatar on another database unless theres a centralized database that stores a single interpretation of your NFT or avatar The biggest issue will be crossplatform compatibility If your assets and NFTs are stored across a dozen different DLTs each platform you use will need to have separate crossplatform interoperability with that DLT If one platform decides not to support the DLT network that records your NFT youre out of luck for that network So what does Web3 provide that Web2 doesnt? More open IdPSSO APIs Instead of using Google MS ADAzure and Okta for your SSO Identity Provider youll be using Web3 stored on some DLT instead of in a centralized database However the exact execution of the NFTWeb3 ID will still depend on how each platform decides to interpret it,0,1,0,1,0
Note Apologies for the multipart post it was the only way I could get it to post to CryptoTechnology 15 Hands down the absolute best real Web 3 use case is the decentralized internet that Skynet Labs has built Skynet is not only a working real world use case of crypto technology but it also abstracts away the complexity of using crypto from the developers and end users amp#x200B For example in order for a web developer to begin developing on Skynet all they need to do is upload their application or website folder containing their indexhtml file to Skynet and their web application or website is immediately available online By simply dragging and dropping a folder into a web page they have made their entire application or website completely decentralized and secure with blockchain technology There is no need for them to buy or hold crypto search for hosting or anything It is just fast secure and free Up to 100gb,1,0,0,1,0
25 To begin actually using Skynet as a user however Homescreen is where you want to start To begin click the Authenticate with MySky button in the top right A popup window will appear with the option to Sign Up at the bottom Once you have clicked Sign Up a MySky account will be created for you and you will be given a 15 word seed phrase This seed phrase is now your password to everything you accesses on Skynet So make sure to write down you seed phrase and store it in a safe location It would also be helpful to sign up for a password manager like Bitwarden so you can securely access your MySky seed from any device Once you have stored your seed in a safe place you can click Sign Up to complete your account creation Once completed you will then see your Homescreen with a couple apps preinstalled for you and you can begin using Skynet as it was intended to be Note If anyone would like to avoid creating their own MySky and want to try the account I set up writing this feel free to use the seed went wanted height boil axes mailed riots waffle mural mumble rising also ahead gables reef To start I would suggest adding SkyOS which is a completely decentralized operating system for all of your web3 apps Once installed click the SkyOS icon to launch into your new OS which can also be accessed directly from Sign in to SkyOS using your MySky seed and grant it access to your MySky Once loaded you can begin exploring your new SkyOS To launch your preinstalled apps use the top left hand menu button and to access your SkyOS settings like your profile OS themes and widgets click your username in the top right corner Once you have finished exploring SkyOS lets manually add a new app to your Homescreen To do so click your username in the top right corner and select Homescreen from the drop down Youll notice that Homescreen currently has a bug which makes the background transparent so for the moment try to ignore that  Once your Homescreen has loaded lets add a decentralized chat similar to Discord To do so type chatbubble into the search bar above and hit enter Once installed you can exit out of your Homescreen and return to your SkyOS Before launching a new application make sure to quickly refresh your SkyOS window to force an update of the app menu Once youve done that you can now access SkyChat from your app menu,0,0,0,1,0
35 Now lets talk about how these apps give you the benefits you are curious about As you already know your MySky account is secured using a seed phrase and blockchain encryption What MySky essentially does is gives you a private place on the Skynet network which all of your user data is stored All of your videos images chats comments likes etc It all get stored on your MySky When you log in to a new application or website on Skynet you are prompted with a permission dialog This is because every application or website on Skynet must ask the user for permission to access the required data needed Because of this the you now has the ability to revoke access to your MySky data at any time and effectively gives the you complete control over your personal data MySky can also be view to act as your universal login similar to Sign in with Google The difference being that unlike Sign in with Google the account you are signing in with is yours and only yours This means you no longer need to worry about losing access to an account because of a deactivated or lost email As for monetization on Skynet that is the the next thing to be implemented and the whitepaper is expected to drop sometime next month What monetization will do is effectively make everything on Skynet into an NFT which can be monetized by the creator Every app website video image and even comments can be monetized This means that every time a new user load or views content on Skynet the creators are getting paid behind the scenes by the user purchasing the content they are viewing This itself is another very lengthy topic so I will not discuss it here lol But this is the gist of how monetization is expected to work amp#x200B I will end this here But please feel free to ask me any further questions and I will gladly try to answer them for you Hope you have fun exploring Skynet and that the real world implications of Web 3 is now clear,1,0,0,1,0

If your data is an NFT it could get tagged as personal data and encrypted so that you can only view it once with onetime passwords That would make it difficult to copy but not impossible There would obviously be some theft but the user would get paid more in that system than in the current system Theoretically it could also be possible to have companies use your data without being able to see the data For example if they tell a smart contract to provide them with some summary information about a data set that contains your info you could get paid if your info happens to be in that dataset OR your personal data could be sold just a single time at the beginning to the network somehow and you get paid only at that point Companies would be unlikely to share proprietary data though as it would be like giving money away to their competitors,1,0,0,1,1
But users could use the service without giving their data to anybody Lets take google docs as an example Their documents are stored and encrypted on IPFS and storage is paid for using filecoin This ensures that the user and only the user has persistent access to their documents The service used to view and edit the document could be executed clientside in the browser if its lightweight enough Or could be a service self hosted by the user Or could even be executed across a distributed network using multi party computation eg Secret network though that might be overkill Regardless all these methods ensure that the users data is operated on securely without leaking the data to anybody else In essence users get the ability to run their own services on their own data without sacrificing privacy and without needing to provide their own infrastructure,1,0,0,1,0
gt In essence users get the ability to run their own services on their own data without sacrificing privacy and without needing to provide their own infrastructure The example you described is basically LibreOffice but my files are encrypted I can do that right now very straightforwardly using existing Web2 without leaking any significant data about myself All I need is encrypted storage which I can get easily using AWS S3 or DropBox and the LibreOffice source code on GitHub,0,0,0,1,0

This can be covered in some ways by the tech implementation For example You can read Xs data only on the Y platform which decrypts it You cannot scrape it copy it download it etc  You could photograph it and then OCR it but you wouldnt have the latest info OR this data could be used by commercial services if the data had an authenticity approval validation stamp that it was extracted from a certain chainprotocoltool For anything commercial there is a counterfeit or a black market of sorts People will always pirate games and music but that does not mean that those two industries will not continue to be worth billions of dollars,0,1,0,0,1
The general theme is to promote and use projects that are based on community being in power and owning data rather than big corps Web2 Dont be evil please Web3 Cant be evil Of couse there will be evil web3 companies like Meta but thats the general guideline I view it as open source projects taken to the next step where it can generate value by itself without having to rely on selfless donations or having corporate forks ie a DAO that controls a decentralized version of twitter would be cool users own their data and the content they generate creates some kind of value and that value is retained by the DAO and redistributed to users themselves This is a pretty big shift from the dynamic from VCs who need to grab as many users as they can and then extract value from them to concentrate that value back to themselves,1,0,0,1,0

Umm I think you answered it No censorship from authorities The only censorship would have to come from network consensus Like when eth split to eth classic it can still happen But with web 30 it wont be a unilateral decision by an ISP or government Failsafe if you have data stored decentralized and backed up in 10 locations instead of a data farm somewhere they may go down Encrypted everything,1,0,0,1,0

I actually just wrote this whole blog post about it and would love feedback # TLDR Blockchain could help businesses move away from using legal contracts and towards what I call procedures For example with traditional contracts a contractor has to hope that the business follows its agreement to pay her invoice and must go to court when it doesnt Instead we should connect computer programs running on the blockchain to the business income source on one side and to the contractors account on the other The program automatically allocates the money as it arrives and can only be reprogramed with the approval of both the business and the contractor Blockchain is what makes this last part possible Theres a bunch of benefits to this approach which I describe in the post,1,0,0,1,0

If you want to think of it in terms of selfhosting your own services like LibreOffice then you can think of Web 30 as the share economy for selfhosting Instead of companies like Amazon or Dropbox providing storage and infrastructure you have a massive community of users providing that infrastructure So really what all decentralization comes down to is where your trust lies Would you rather place your trust in big companies or in a community of users? I think Web 20 has shown what companies will do when given power over data and services They get lazy and dont care about user privacy They get greedy and sell user data They get selfish and design their services to keep users in the ecosystem instead working together with other companies to provide interoperability Web 30 is about decentralizing trust to prevent these things from occurring Everything is public and transparent so you know exactly what is happening to your data Everything runs on the same layer so programs and services are interoperable Anybody can become a dataservice provider which increases competition and keeps prices low And these are just a few of the downstream benefits of decentralizing power and trust,1,1,0,1,0
gt So really what all decentralization comes down to is where your trust lies Ok but do you think fuck shady Web2 companies and vague claims about interoperability are really enough of a reason to bring everyone to decentralised blockchain computing which is magnitudes more inefficient and expensive compared to Web2 infrastructure? The fastest most featurecomplete applications will always be those where were not artificially limited to a distributed trustless consensus algorithms Given human nature and various laws of least resistance Web3 is only happening if Web2 gets outlawed Itd be helpful if you could point me to a coherent and complete description of a useful Web3 application real or imaginary I think thats what OP is looking for not buzzwordsbuzzphrases Show how all this decentralisation trustlessness privacy interoperability and tokenisation all adds up to some killer app that isnt possible in Web2,0,1,0,0,1
gt Ok but do you think fuck shady Web2 companies and vague claims about interoperability are really enough I do Just like fuck overpriced taxis were enough to get many people to move to Uber and Lyft and fuck surveillance was enough to get many people to move to Bitcoin and Monero I think getting everybody will take time but I personally am moving away from big tech services and I think as alternatives mature more people will move as well I do agree that in some cases centralization will probably always be more efficient But its hard to tell just how much more efficient because Web 30 is so new I think give it a few more years and well see how fast Web 30 can really get Because after a certain point performance actually doesnt matter as much anymore If a website loads in 03 seconds versus 035 I probably wont notice And when the differences in performance are that small other things become more important Like flexibility and privacy and interoperability For example the iPad Pro is probably the fastest tablet out there Yet I still wouldnt prefer one because other tablets are fast enough and less locked down And I know there are plenty others like me As for a concrete example of a Web 30 application theres a list of them here One of the apps listed there is dtube which is a video platform like Youtube but uses IPFS for storage and Avalon blockchain for the database I noticed that a few videos are just youtube embeds but the vast majority seem to be legitimate IPFS videos and performance is great too,0,1,0,1,1
Fuck overpriced X is exactly why people wont use Web3 technologies Blockchain technologies always have a higher computational cost due to computing their consensus algorithms BitcoinMonero have very real use cases anonymised wealth holdings and transfers Tax evasion black markets crypto currency has made these things a whole lot easier Bitcoin was immediately useful you didnt even have to imagine or adopt hyperbolic language like were seeing with Web3 tech Web3 technologies are improving but theres no way around established laws of distributed computing It will always be more expensive and less performant to operate on the blockchain unless theres some high cost associated with a trustful model In the case of black markets and tax evasion trustful modelstrusting the bank and Visa etc has a huge huge cost real probability of imprisonment When it comes to watching TikTok videos trustful doesnt really have that much of a negative cost Making TikTok trustless would just be a huge waste of computing resources and no ones going to foot the bill for it Unfortunately the efficiency will never be close to the kind of numbers you cited Web3 will never be only 17 slower than Web2 dtube looks to be a standard Web2 service just that it utilises IPFS assets Its fundamental operation doesnt depend on the blockchain in any way we have a multitude of faster Web2 alternatives The pros of utilising blockchainbacked storage here are The cons of this are higher storage cost than centralised solutions higher latencies etc,0,1,1,0,1
gt higher computational cost due to computing their consensus algorithms The costs have been coming down quickly For example Layer 2 solutions dont even use consensus The consensus is only used to cement transactions onto the blockchain and they can combine many transactions in a single block to make it more efficient Solutions like Iota dont require consensus across the whole network so they can process transactions faster and cheaper There are improvements happening all the time I dont deny that centralized solutions will be faster But the difference in performance will get smaller and smaller Making other advantages more enticing And one of those advantages that we havent covered yet is censorship For example certain words will get you banned or your content removed on Twitter and Facebook and Youtube even if you are just using them in jokes Decentralized solutions like dtube can help to solve that problem People can create their own communities that have their own rules about what content is allowed and not allowed Its certainly possible for Web 2 companies to do the same but theyve proven again and again that they can be swayed by politics People are already moving to federated systems like the Fediverse or Matrix for chat and then decentralized systems like Peertube and dtube for video And these decentralized technologies are still in very early stages Dtube uses IPFS and Avalon not a single part of it is Web 2 And its fundamental service does depend on decentralization if you consider censorship resistance to be a fundamental part which they do The pros is also no ads as compared to Youtube In the future I expect there will be some payment involved either by providing storagecompute resources from your PC or by paying money but I suspect it will still be cheaper than paying for Youtube Premium gt Web3 will never be only 17 slower than Web2 I believe it will actually be much lower at least lower than 10 IPFS and Webtorrent already work quite well and as the networks grow bigger they will get faster But neither of us really have proof because the tech is still so premature so well just have to see,1,0,0,1,0
Im aware that layer 2 solutions are fast but they have their own set of issues upon reintegration with the layer 1 Censorship resistance is a big pro of Web3 certainly But do you think thats enticing enough to sway your average user away from existing media giants? Come join my censorship resistance platform! There are no intelligent recommendations and you have to pay xhour of footage but Alex Jones will be able to post conspiracy theories I dont think it will ever by cheaper than YouTube premium because YouTube will always always have the advantage of lower computational costs and engineering complexity Blockchain technologies by definition require redundant computations which arent required in centralised solutions A large part of ads is to pay content creators too so you should jointly consider their incentivesdisincentives towards an adfree Web3 platform,0,1,0,1,1
As the US becomes more and more polarized Big Tech is being forced to pick a side Its not just Alex Jones being kicked off nowadays its entire communities being restricted Which is why interest in alternatives is growing I personally dont care for the politics the concept of censorshipresistance in itself is powerful enough for me One of the main reasons why I think Web3 can be cheaper than Youtube Premium or Netflix is because users can contribute their resources To give a comparison you can look at torrenting Its quite surprising that people are willing to seed esp when game theory predicts that everybody would leech But the torrent community is still rather healthy and still growing,0,1,0,1,0
You and I both care about censorship resistance but we arent typical users Typical users will want their bells and whistles all running smoothly and promptly No one will use dtube until it has a better user experience compared to YouTube,0,1,0,0,1
Its not just cencorship resistance its privacy too With third party services if a company can be pressured into stripping peoples privacy for the greater good it often happens Eg the NSAs surveillance after 911 Or Apples CSAM scanning More and more people are caring about privacy nowadays So I think if a decentralized service can provide say 9095 of the performance of a normal web service but with much better privacy and censorship resistance I think people will switch Matrix chat is one example Ive seen on the rise recently,0,1,0,1,1
No The main difference is you can run a node thanks the blockchain technology amp#x200B Example 1 Google Inc has a search engine google search executed on its physical computers google physical servers amp#x200B In the decentralized web every user can use its computer as server The Search Engine is distributed Distributed computing This server is a node of the network blockchain Call this user nodeuser amp#x200B When a simple user searches for a word the computer of the nodeuser is used to perform the search The nodeuser get money Today Google get money About security and privacy everything is encrypted Today google can read the searched word and the user ip Google can block some words and manipulates the results rank Example amp#x200B Example2 Distributed Cloud and hosting servers Every nodeuser can host a piece of a website data chuking The website is splitted between several nodes amp#x200B amp#x200B amp#x200B Example3 Facebook Metaverse VS Decentraland amp#x200B amp#x200B amp#x200B Example4 Tor is like a VPN but is decentralized so its safer for the privacy and censorship amp#x200B amp#x200B Remark The main difference between the web3 and the web1 oor web2 is the blockchain tecnology in particular the ethereum blockchain With it is possible to get distibuted storage ditributed computation encryption modern consensus policies proof of work proof of stack etc,0,1,0,1,0

about 8 months ago which was a steady period after a drop off there was about 3 million active gaming wallets where about 1 million were thought to be real people theres really no difference between web 2 and 3 besides whos playing ball The only part that benefits you as a dev is if your game is slated to reach 1 million players or less then you have a secured 1 million strong playerbase if your game is actually good considering theres virtually no competition game service whatever If its slated to reach more then theres virtually no reason as a dev either Why people are in web 3? They believe their ideals align with the ideals of those others in the space along the lines of everyones going to make it even though its largely surmised that institutions hold the majority of crypto already So they believe its about chasing the next thing before institutional investmentownership in a hopefully decentralized model that creates lasting value for all involved and not just investment whales who often invest and leave and dont participate Surprisingly simple but yet to be achieved Communism anyone? So ultimately speaking web 3 doesnt exist and is largely a group of idealsmorals that would probably be more fitting as a sub genre of gamingweb2 rather than a holistic system that will subvert either entirely Hope this helps this is just my perspective,0,1,0,0,1
Hey everyone I have a hot take on web3 Even though I work in the DeFi sector I believe web3 started backwards It showed up with high volatility risks and products that cater to a very small niche population willing to take those risks Web3 tokens are highly volatile but they often have huge threedigit APYs when the market is bullish This contrasts sharply with the traditional financial system where banks offer 12 APY stocks average 24 APY and treasury bonds range from 215 APY at most A threedigit APY often sounds like one of those get rich quick scams pyramid schemes or MLM businesses making people understandably cautious When I say web3 started backwards I mean that until recently barely any web3 business or startup offered realworld value products These are things like real estate treasury bonds stocks and ETFs It took the web3 space 14 years since the creation of Bitcoin to offer something that regular investors and everyday people are looking for I believe this is how web3 will attract many early adopters However fullscale adoption wont happen until people use web3 without realizing theyre using web3 What do I mean by this? Think of it like how grandma doesnt need to understand how her TV works or how its motherboard lets her watch her favorite shows She just needs to press the red button and start watching her Soap Opera I believe technology becomes fully adopted when customers get what they need seamlessly without having to navigate complicated processes or understand the underlying technology Thats when it becomes successful and most of web3 hasnt understood it yet,0,1,0,1,1
Im not sure I agree with your examples either though Youre saying the supply limitation on BTC dampers its network effect I dont see how it is relevant Its divisible to what 8 decimal points? Bitcoin certainly has a network effect and that has led to its growth A form of money or value derives its liquidity and price from the network effect If nobody used Bitcoin then it would be worthless NFTs are a bit different because they are unique and indivisible Still an NFT is valuable because the demand outweighs the supply A network effect of sorts The minute the demand disappears the value of the NFT disappears with it It has no intrinsic value to give it a price floor The network effect and its direction will determine its price,0,1,0,1,0

Theres a few points that come to mind 1 as a way to pay for services Right now its common to use a payment gateway which requires registration and setup with a company for it they take a percentage of the revenue can have downtimes maintenance or other complications With the blockchain you can verify if youve received funds or you can send funds directly over the blockchain without needing to rely on any third party system For smaller developers they can easily setup revenue systems for their projects that they wouldnt otherwise bother with if they had to setup a system with a payment processor link their bank etc but they can easily implement it with crypto for free and with little effort amp#x200B 2 DApps Many applications can and do live entirely on the blockchain This includes marketplaces exchanges games lending services and plenty of others Because they are on the blockchain theres zero maintenance cost in terms of servers databases etc and theres no risk of your system going down like a server can You will probably want to deploy a website that helps with interacting with your DApp but you can use a free service host it for free on your github pages or just rent a cheap domain to host it This isnt that big of a feature to large companies but in terms of us small developers or those of us who deploy a lot of hobby projects hosting costs can be quite prohibitive and being able to make networked projects that live on like that is massive and allows more individuals to make contributions that are usable by others amp#x200B 3 Interoperability With something like NFTs or crypto currencies you can make applications that can use other peoples creations directly For example with NFTs you could create a DApp game that allows players to bet their NFTs You dont need to specify which NFTs are allowed anyone can just create them and use them with your app directly They simply work together by default All assets on the chain work in a standard way like that so you can develop applications that allow you to integrate with other applications without them needing to build specific infrastructure for it Right now each service implements their own database to track assets so if you have an item on steam then they track your ownership of it and its not interoperable with anywhere else This means you are locked into what they have designed for the items a simple marketplace and trading for other steam items If it had been done with NFTs then you could use them in any system youd like Want to lend steam items that youre not using? use a service for that and make some passive income off the items Have a rare item like a CSGO knife that would give better profit if auctioned? find an NFT exchange with auctions steam only allows limit orders You also arent limited to steam money anymore and its just overall better to have things interoperable like that and with web3 its easy to do and you dont need to worry about your database being exploited or having bugs especially duplication or other severe bugs because the transferring of tokens both fungible and NFTs can be implemented by tokens using finitestate machines which secures them against tampering at a languagelevel amp#x200B Im sure youll get a number of other answers but as a developer these were the large ones that stand out for me,1,0,0,1,0
Thom Im not 100 sold on this By definition the network effect happens when a products value increases with an increase in users This is true for Web2 but for Web3 too The perfect example is gaming A multiplayer with 100 users has not the same value as one with 500000 Gaming will be one of the main use cases of Web3 and Im pretty sure that the network effect will play a significant role there too Another example is Dapps The more Dapps on a certain blockchain the more adoption of that blockchain the more network effect for that chain Another one is coins El Salvador or other countries could use one of the many cryptos available But they use Bitcoin because of the network effect,0,1,0,1,0
To the extent that crypto gaming becomes successful it will do so because of the ability to use and sell items across games That will diminish the ability to keep people inside the same network reduce the power of network effect for any given entity Coins I agree but my definition of Web3 is that it sits on top of the blockchain and again you arent locked in like you are in web2 Maybe I was a little unclear by I thought it was obvious that I was making a comparison to Web2 which have some very specific usages of network effect,0,1,0,1,0
The network effects are the same Its just harder for companies to separate the user from the value created Web30 essentially makes Facebook shareholders and Facebook users one and the samealmost There will still be network effects to Web30 companies because someone needs to organize the blockchains Thats actually a good argument for why a Web30 company can never be as big market capwise as a Web20 company,1,1,0,0,0

I agree in part but theres a big twist to the story network effects of web3 will be found but at the protocol level as opposed to the application level So I agree with the premise but only as it relates to the applications themselves As users pile onto a chain the protocol itself becomes the primary store of value as opposed to the apps that ride on top of it And its the protocol chain that will realize network effects Here is a super insightful article ,0,1,0,1,0
Oh I agree How I define Web3 is the layer on top of the underlying protocols and they utilize network effect but even in that case the interoperability makes it possible to migrate much more easily and thus again much less trapped behind some gated community because of its network effect and closedness,1,0,0,1,0
Gotcha To me the fat protocol itself is one of the defining characteristics of Web3 its great enabler ,1,0,0,1,0
Ive had similar thoughts Many things will not transfer or equate the Same on web3 The reason web2 is as successful is because the users are free to access a majority of it Web3 being so currency hyper focused is a huge hill to climb I believe that youll see some kind of integration between the two of them and thats where the real success will be A game like RuneScape minting NFTs for your inventory Amazon offering Amazon crypto for select purchases and then using it to buytrade books or movies Eventually someones going to nail it and everybodys gonna say how do we not see this,0,1,0,1,0
You are right My headline was a little harsh Obviously the underlying blockchain itself have to have some network effect But its an important distinction IMO that it will at least be much harder given the cost associated with doing anything in crypto land and the fact that users instead of ex a Facebook is paying for their participation,0,1,0,0,1

Accidental Private Key Exposure on USER! Recently Ive noticed a lot of key rotation issues on Aptos For those who arent familiar in Aptos the public address is permanent always matching the accounts initial authentication key The ability to sign for an account can be transferred to another private key The most obvious reason for this issue is private key leakage In Aptos the account address public address and private key are all universally represented as 32byte hex strings which is where the problem begins One such case involved a person I know who accidentally posted his private key instead of his account address As soon as the private key was leaked someone used it to execute the accountrotateauthenticationkey function Interestingly he was using sponsored transactions where the feepayer wallets seemed to be funded from centralized exchanges So far I havent seen any outgoing transactions from those rotated accounts Ive identified two feepayer wallets 1 aptoscancomaccount0xde69b 2 aptoscancomaccount0x5428f Ive added a list of keyrotated addresses with these fee payers here dunecomantokanaaccounts This is clearly a case of human error and we need to be careful when copying and pasting addresses One simple solution is to add a 1byte flag before the 32byte private key using Bech32 encoding Yes similar to what Sui does Its a straightforward and effective way to avoid mistakes when accidentally sharing private keys If anyone has a different approach feel free to share itmaybe we can propose an improvement USER USER USER USER USER,0,0,1,0,1

Currently web3 is fragmentedx000D x000D Users need to manage multiple wallets gas tokens bridge assets across chainsx000D x000D Chain abstraction is designed to fix this by enabling users to interact with dApps without worrying about which chain theyre on or which token they need for fees,0,0,0,1,1
So how exactly does it work?x000D x000D Chain abstraction works through middleware or protocols acting as intermediaries between users blockchainsx000D x000D These intermediaries handle transaction routing gas fees asset bridging across networks,0,0,0,1,0
For example if youre using a dApp that supports chain abstraction it can automatically choose the best blockchain for your transactionx000D x000D You dont need to manually switch networks or hold gas tokens from multiple chainsx000D x000D The process is seamless,1,0,0,1,0
The key benefits?x000D x000D Smooth interaction across chains with your assets accountsx000D x000D Technical complexities are hidden letting you focus on the dAppx000D x000D Devs can build dApps not tied to one chain reaching more usersx000D x000D Source,1,0,0,1,0

With receipts categorically stating that no data on the blockchain can be altered and that every transaction can be read onchain by just anyone it unlocked yet another web3 grail in the eyes of the masses TRANSPARENCYx000D 9,1,0,0,1,0
Since Web3 represents the advancing phase of the internets evolution with the aim to foster a more decentralized and accountable society then it is really a nobrainer that only transparency can build trustx000D And this is where web3 education comes inx000D 10,1,0,0,1,0
For every good thing to thrive it has to first of all break its obstacles In the case of web3 adoption in Nigeria the major dilemma is not just a mere lack of awareness but the lack of awareness that web3 is NOT a scamx000D A major misconception in Nigeriax000D 11,0,1,0,0,1
Fortunately some wonderful web3 communities were gradually growing and some enthusiasts were spearheading this adoption For instance USER was actively holding physical seminars and spaces USER was hosting twitter spaces through USER x000D 13,1,0,0,1,0
but they also served as a platform where enthusiasts can mutually hunt for opportunities either through airdrops trading or NFT flipsx000D USER was also pushing strides with Daba School and USER was doing the same with Alpha Academyx000D 15,1,0,0,1,0
To include women in the web3 space that was gradually getting saturated with men communities like the USER and USER embarked on a mission to onboard educate and empower more women in web3 through their exclusive communitiesx000D 16,1,0,0,1,0
On other platforms like Facebook we have USER and USER who actively encourage more people to join the web3 space by highlighting and educating them on the opportunities in Web3x000D 17,1,0,0,1,0
Was it really so easy to take a picture upload it on the blockchain and make about N2m in Nigerian currency?x000D This led to a rise in NFT interest in the country and everyone was minting just about any picture they laid their hands on with an outrageous price attached to itx000D 19,1,1,1,0,0
With the rush of enthusiasm came the cold embrace of disappointment from the lack of selling the said NFTsx000D On the brighter side many eventually understood that NFTs are more than mere Jpegs and just like some addiction it was already too late to leave this NFT opiatex000D 20,1,0,1,0,0
Like many other countries there a quite a lot of socioeconomical problems in the country that web3 can help solve After all what is the essence of web3 adoption if it is not problem solving?x000D 21,1,0,0,1,0
When Nigeria leverages Web3 technologies problems such as salary delays utility bill payment verification of transactions fast crossborder payments inflation currency devaluation unemployment and even inheritance problems can be efficiently solvedx000D 22,1,0,0,1,0

The Twitter ban which affected many enthusiasts from actively following some web3 communities and spaces was nullified by the use of VPNs lack of technological development in many areas encouraged educators to hold more physical seminarsx000D 28,0,0,1,0,1
Web3 adoption and education cannot be overemphasized this why I must also commend the USER for the extensive research and education hosted by my colleagues and I am also grateful for the opportunity to drive web3 forward with themx000D LET US MAKE WEB3 GREAT AGAIN! x000D 30,1,0,0,1,0

This approach addresses issues such asx000D x000D By abstracting execution logic from the core blockchain infrastructure it standardizes data formats and transaction structuresx000D x000D This enables developers to create applications that can run on multiple chains without needing to deeply integrate or rewrite code for each chain,0,0,0,1,0

Did you know about our Future Transactions feature? In Web3 users often rely on bridges to move assets across chains which means handing control to intermediaries that can be compromised But with Pera ZTPs users stay in control of their assets  and every transaction requires user participation So how do we handle future events like liquidations in DeFi without sacrificing control? Thats where the Future Transaction feature comes in Users can preapprove a specific action like liquidation which is signed in advance If the conditions are met the ZTP automatically completes the transaction no further input needed but the users control remains intact Unlike traditional protocols theres no carte blanche for the ZTP it executes only what the user consented to providing a secure and userfirst solution to future event ,1,0,0,1,0

#Privacy on Blockchain A Myth? In our last thread we talked about the transparency vs privacy dilemma in blockchains Extending ahead Im sharing about some cryptographic solutions that can address these challenges FHE ZKPs MPC ,0,0,0,1,1
Fully Homomorphic Encryption FHE Definition #FHE allows you to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it This means sensitive data can remain private even while being processed RealWorld Example Imagine a researcher analyzing encrypted medical data to derive health insightswithout ever having access to the actual patient records! This ensures patient privacy while enabling valuable research Advantages Total privacy during computations Can be applied to private smart contracts and privacypreserving computations in #DeFi Disadvantages High computational overhead and latency Validators can decrypt results so they must be trusted not to leak data,0,0,0,1,1
MultiParty Computation MPC Definition #MPC allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private Each party learns the outcome but not the individual inputs of others RealWorld Example Imagine several banks detecting fraud patterns by analyzing their combined customer datawithout any bank revealing its own customer data to others! Advantages Decentralized control of sensitive data Robust security guarantees in collaborative computations Disadvantages High coordination and communication overhead More participants can make computations slower and more complex,0,0,0,1,1
ZeroKnowledge Proofs ZKPs Advantages #ZKPs enable one party the prover to prove to another party the verifier that a statement is true without revealing the statement itself Variants like ZKSNARKs and ZKSTARKs are commonly used RealWorld Example Proving that youre over 18 to access an agerestricted service without revealing your actual birth date Its like saying Trust me Im old enough! but without showing your ID Advantages Lightweight proofs with fast verification Enhances privacy without revealing the actual data Disadvantages Implementation complexity and high initial setup It is hard to perform transactions involving multiple private states at once Some ZKP variants eg ZKSNARKs require a trusted setup which can be a security risk if compromised,1,0,0,1,0

The narrative around privacy has been completely misguided Projects like USER and USER have been hailed as the pinnacle of privacy in crypto They use advanced cryptography to hide transaction details amounts senders recipients In the current paradigm this is what privacy looks like These privacy coins are essentially just creating perfect silos Theyre great at hiding data but terrible at utilizing it Its privacy through obscurity not privacy through utility Weve been operating under the assumption that privacy means hiding everything But in a datadriven world this approach is like locking your most valuable assets in an impenetrable vault and throwing away the key Safe? Yes Useful? Not so much The true challenge isnt just hiding data its enabling computation on sensitive data without exposing it Its about proving the validity of computations without revealing the underlying information or programmable cryptography Current privacy solutions in crypto dont even begin to address this Imagine a DeFi protocol like USER that can use your realworld credit score without you ever revealing the actual number Or a decentralized prediction market like USER that can aggregate sensitive data from multiple sources without any single entity seeing the raw data Thats where were headed The future isnt about creating more sophisticated ways to hide transactions Its about enabling verifiable trustless computation on encrypted data Its not Monero 20 its an entirely new paradigm ZKPs are a start but theyre just one piece of the puzzle The real gamechanger is combining ZKPs with other advanced cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption USER secure multiparty computation USER or combinations of many like garbled circuits and MPC USER The end game is a system where data can be used without being exposed Where computations can be verified without revealing inputs Where multiple parties can collaborate on sensitive data without trusting each other This will be the true unlock of crypto,0,1,0,1,0

FHE is the next big thing in PRIVACY!!! Some say its like ZK but with even more potential! Want to know why PRIVACY is taking off in WEB3? Let me break it down for you in this thread ,1,0,0,1,0
Privacy is crucial Hela offers better protections through secure environments and encryption Plus it includes communitydriven rules to keep everything in check USER USER USER #crew3xyz #community #web3,1,0,0,0,1
3n The Big terms ZKMPCTEE FHE isnt alone in the privacy game Other key players? ZeroKnowledge ZK MultiParty Computation MPC and Trusted Execution Environments TEE ZK ZK proofs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information! MPC Multiple parties compute together without leaking data but it struggles if they collude! TEE TEEs provide a secure area within a processor for executing code and storing sensitive data! but ZK MPC and TEEbased solutions lack providing composable privacy in a most efficient way! heres a good table by USER,0,0,0,1,0
4n Key Industry players using FHE? You must be thinking that this is some new shit people experimenting in Web3 but its has been used by Web2 Giants like USER USER USER USER USER etc since past few years!

1n Why PRIVACY? As the Eth ecosystem is saturated Ethereum and EVM compatible chains are public and they lack privacy! There are many useful Web2 applications that cant be built on top of blockchain like Games and Finance or any other application with private data!

wrote it a while ago but still valid today MASS ADOPTION why hasnt it happened yet? Got some thoughts about this #1 The Bridge to Masses For web3 to truly take off we need bridges brands that leverage the tech to create userfriendly products But heres the catch these projects must solve problems for the masses not just for the crypto crowd #2 Isolation in Tech Tech founders often get lost in their passion for the technology Isolation from nontech communities leads to a disconnect We need to understand the needs of potential users which requires reaching beyond the tech sphere #3 Speaking a Different Language Tech jargon can be intimidating People have short attention spans in a fastpaced world Keep it simple! Complex terms only alienate potential users Lets create content that anyone can understand #4 Not Every Solution Needs Education While education is valuable we cant expect everyone to delve into complex tech details Most folks wont go out of their way to learn blockchain Solutions must be intuitive requiring minimal effort #5 Barriers to Entry Simple actions in the web3 world can be complex for newcomers We need seamless solutions that minimize barriers Just like sending an email people care about ease of use not the underlying tech #6 UserCentric Approach Mass adoption requires a shift in perspective Instead of token holders we need communities of future users Building userfocused products outside the crypto bubble is key to speeding up adoption #7 Do we really want it? To be honest I am not even so sure people in the sphere actually want mass adoption so much Yes they keep talking about how much they want it nonstop but I am no longer convinced Often what people say and actually think are 2 different things In conclusion web3 mass adoption isnt just about technology its about understanding people By solving real problems for the masses with userfriendly solutions we can pave the way for the future,1,1,1,1,1

I am not excited by any Cardano crosschain discussions weekend thoughts im seeing more discussions arise about Liquidity and Crosschain integration and just wanted to share an unspokenunvoiced perspective whilst im a huge fan of an omnichain web3 space when it comes to moving liquidity across chains the main question that needs to be answered is why? why would i move my liquidity from chain 1 to chain 2? the simplest answer there is an opportunity on the other chain whether that opportunity is in the form of some financial gain to be made degen usecase or for some techrelated functionalities to be executed eg settlement the bottom line is that there is an opportunity on the other chain now that the context is set above lets look at these examples in relation to cardano most of the discussions that are arising from within or about cardanos crosschain capabilities are in relation to the degen usecases dexhunter crosschain swaps to move liquidity iagon cex listing visibility on cex for token heck theres even a new smart wallet coming that claims crosschain capabilities but whats the point? cardanos degen activityrelated volume nft defi trading is so low compared to other chains that theres no incentive for users to come into cardano given the primary crosschain topic are degen focussed it makes one wonder about the necessity for these crosschain tools its also worrying to see that there are hardly any techrelated crosschain discussions happening except one i will touch on below and failure from the community to realise that its the techrelated discussions that interest the higherlever investors in web3 is why I am not excited by any Cardano crosschain discussions study zues protocol on solana study wormhole study layer zero study polygons agglayer goals these are good examples of crosschain goals that are both tech and degen centric please can the cardano community stop wearing this hypocritical hat of being antidegen whilst simultaneously relying solely on degencentric use cases whilst discussing crosschain now rant aside i have to give credit where credit due study fluidtokens they are the only project i am aware of doing crosschain in cardano right their evm contract deployment mimic thing tbh thats the only way i can word it is leveraging cardanos tech to bring over liquidity from evm whilst levergaing cardanos infrastructure to process everything degen usecase techcentric use case their expansion into lending borrowing on oridnals is another great example of both degen usecase whilst expanding the tech from cardano onto bitcoin value accredits back to fluidtokens in the process which may credit back to a number go up asset here everything else labelled crosschain in cardano i see as a hail mary from builders here for other chains to notice cardano we dont need to be begging for attention we have a great tech layer what we need more of is to show builders new and current why they should expand their businesss tech stack to involve cardanos layer for their technical purposes maybe its just me but i have a good feeling that all these crosschain discussions is just a prayer for attention and may result in the inverse of the desired outcome time will tell,0,1,0,1,1

Thoughts on the Future of Ethereum L1 and L2 Ive been a developer for 15 years and in the web3 space for 2 years Ive participated in several hackathons including EthDenver where I met an amazing community!! However Im currently concerned about the direction Ethereum is taking Here are my observations Current state With the introduction of protodanksharding which helps reduce L2 fees through Blobs and Vitaliks latest article vitalikethlimogeneral202 its become clear that Ethereums future is heavily leaning towards L2 solutions The fees for L1 have made it almost unusable for daily transactions As a result weve seen an explosion in the number of L2s intensifying this past year Polygon Optimism Arbitrum Skroll zkSync Linea Blast Base etc Each L2 touts its own benefits and has its marketing to attract liquidity like the massive future airdrops announced by Blast Future Vitaliks article encourages applications to focus on developing on a specific L2 So not only will we see a division of liquidity among all L2s but also a lack of uniformity in applications This will force us to either stick with one L2 or constantly use bridges Who controls the L2s? This becomes clear with the rise of Base developed by Coinbase Its an L2 developed by a publicly traded company must adhere to US law has no token no DAO and no accessible MemPool Questions How can we be happy about the division of liquidity and applications? How can we not be worried about the influence of Base especially since its the most commercially driven L2? How can we explain to users that were adding the complexity of bridges on top of existing complexities that are still unresolved? Isnt there a mediumterm risk of L2s adding features that would make EVM incompatible across different chains? What are your thoughts?,0,1,0,1,1

Web3 Glossary Term #3 Decentralization There are 4000 DAOs in the #Web3 space as per a 2022 report by Forbes This is not just a number It shows that 4000 Web3 communities are decentralized But what is #Decentralization? And how is it different from centralization? Decentralization is essentially a topdown approach It is the name of successful diffusion of power This means that in a decentralized system or organization everyone has the decisionmaking authority It plays an important role in blockchain and Web3 In fact it is one of the unique selling points of the Web3 ecosystem Decentralization in Web3 removes the central authority and creates a peertopeer network As a result it empowers individuals and communities by reducing the risk of a singleparty control Research also shows that decentralized storage is safer than cloud storage centralized storage when it comes to managing data Decentralization is a key highlight of Web3 but some argue its overemphasized What are other lesstalkedabout strengths of Web3 and #blockchain?

Its a good question Ill try and write a proper post about it but an initial stream of thoughts are BD is enjoyable when most leads are inbound I dont think this is happening at the moment so these new BD people will be mostly outbound focused New Web3 projects are challenging to outbound to as they are difficult to identify So these new reps will likely focus on Enterprise and perhaps a few large established dApps For Enterprise where do they focus? Which companies do they Outbound to? Domain expertise is important so who can they pull in to support the engagement eg if it a Loyalty and Reward opportunity who can they bring in that understands this space deeply? Most Enterprise engagements are 12 months long and most end in nodecision Its a long time to know if the rep is performing or if it is other factors Most Enterprise want to engage via PoC so who can help scope the technical detail and then who can deliver the PoC? Most Enterprise will want a contract and SLAs who is the contracting entity? Almost all deals are pay to play so what source of funds can be used for time sensitive competitive deals? If we win the deal who will then build the solution most Enterprises dont have the capability And to be persuasive throughout this process it is helpful to have relevant case studies references all types of sales collateral much of which doesnt yet exist even a basic intro to Polkadot deck has been challenging to keep up to date Most Enterprise want to deal with the core team want to talk road map do these BD people have the backing of Parity Polkadot long term? The likes of Solana can bring in Anatoly to help close deals If a dApp deal the BD person will need to pull in the relevant Parachain How can these BD people stay across the latest from the ecosystem and develop relationships with key parts of the ecosystem and treat all players fairly?

In the realm of Web3 where decentralization and blockchain technology shape the landscape the notion of getting ensnared in someone elses illicit activities takes on a new dimension Unlike the traditional web Web3 offers both unparalleled opportunities and unprecedented risks The decentralized nature of Web3 means that transactions and interactions are recorded on a public ledger leaving a transparent trail of activity While this fosters trust and accountability it also means that individuals must exercise caution as every digital footprint can potentially implicate them in the actions of others Implicating yourself in someone elses illegal activities especially when its been clearly recognized as problematic can exacerbate the repercussions Ignoring red flags or turning a blind eye to suspicious behavior not only increases the likelihood of being implicated but also magnifies the severity of the consequences Whether its a failure to report criminal behavior actively participating in illicit activities or knowingly benefiting from illgotten gains each instance of implication carries its own set of risks From legal ramifications to tarnished reputations and damaged relationships the fallout from involvement in unlawful conduct can be significant and enduring Moreover in the eyes of the law claiming ignorance or innocence may offer little solace if evidence suggests complicity or willful negligence In essence choosing to overlook warning signs or dismiss concerns regarding the legality of ones actions can compound the problems exponentially Its imperative to recognize the gravity of the situation and take proactive steps to distance oneself from any involvement in criminal behavior Doing so not only safeguards ones own wellbeing but also upholds ethical standards and societal norms hopifoundationorg,0,1,0,0,1

I wrote this about a week ago but I thought it may have oversimplified some things about ICP Today I realized people who are brand new to #WEB3 and especially #ICP may appreciate some simplicity before digging deeper Plus everybody loves a good analogy! Lets dive into the Internet Computer Protocol with a focus on the market dynamics including the manipulation by Sam BankmanFried and FTX Market Misunderstandings Picture the cryptocurrency market as a bustling farmers market When ICP set up its stall launched the market was already in a frenzy with people investors rushing to buy anything in sight hoping to find the next big thing Then imagine a wellknown market influencer Sam BankmanFried starts hyping up a particular fruit no need to mention it it wasnt the communities fault while secretly doing things that make the rest of the market seem less appealing As a result when ICP opened for business it was like someone had shouted fire in the crowded market Everyone rushed to the exits sold their ICP causing a panic and driving prices down not because the produce ICP was bad but because of the chaos and manipulation in the market This initial manipulation and the FUD that followed has kept ICP on the decline until recently What ICP Brings to the Table Think of ICP as a new revolutionary supermarket that aims to change how we shop for groceries Unlike traditional supermarkets owned by a few large companies this supermarket lets local farmers developers sell directly to customers users without needing to go through middlemen This makes the whole shopping experience more direct fresher and potentially cheaper showing how ICP wants to reshape the internet to work more efficiently and fairly for everyone Growing and Learning ICPs growth is akin to a city developing its infrastructure Initially there were some construction delays and disagreements on the design early technical issues and community disagreements However over time roads have been paved buildings erected and the city is starting to take shape This urban development represents ICPs progression and its continuous efforts to improve and expand its capabilities despite the initial challenges Building a Community Imagine ICP as a collaborative community garden project where everyone is welcome to plant water and grow their own produce Each gardener data center contributes a plot of land node to the garden and together they create a diverse and thriving ecosystem of plants projects and applications The Dfinity Foundations funding is like a grant that provides seeds tools and resources to encourage more gardeners to join enriching the gardens biodiversity and productivity Through these analogies its easier to grasp or at least start to grasp the intricacies behind ICPs journey highlighting not only the challenges and controversies it has faced such as the market manipulation by highprofile figures but also the innovative and communitydriven solutions it proposes for the future of the internet ICP is the only completely on chain blockchain that doesnt rely on centralized servers ICP is also the most wellrounded blockchain allowing it to be The World Computer This is still the beginning of the #ICyou havent seen anything yet! #Investment #Web3 #TechTrends #Blockchain #CryptoInvesting #FinTech #Ethereum #StartupLife #AI #MachineLearning #DataScience #CyberSecurity #VirtualReality #CloudComputing #IoT #DigitalCurrency #SmartContracts #DeFi #TechInnovation #NFTs #TechStartups #Coding #SoftwareDevelopment #TechNews #VentureCapital,1,0,0,1,0

Tomato Thoughts Part 2 But what about stepping away? Is this just a fleeting thought or is the universe pushing me to grow? As I think about this life outside of Web3 has been incredibly exciting Going back to a Web2 role after years of running my own business was scary Yet this week has been amazingIve hit goals I didnt see coming thrived in teamwork and found joy in our collective success In the middle of celebrating these Web2 victories I found myself commemorating it in a familiar yet unexpected wayI got myself a 2nd Gen USER Its not just a digital image to me it symbolizes my journey the challenges Ive overcome and the new heights Ive reached Interestingly ducks have always been a recurring theme in my life symbolizing both nostalgia and new beginnings Theres a deeper story there but maybe thats for another time But theres a part of my Web3 journey I dont acknowledge enough the person behind the ducks Hes pushed me out of my comfort zone and there were times I was so frustrated I wished I could just walk away or burn a duck But in truth hes been a driving force for growth constantly encouraging us to go beyond our limits no matter how frustrating it feels Hes there every day fueling the space with unmatched passion moving us forward even when wed rather stop His continuous drive has pushed us to work harder aim higher and think bigger A big shoutout to USER And heres where I feel a call to explore this journey more publiclybecause from what Im hearing Im not the only one searching for more than just the next flip or the next portal coin Some of us are yearning for something deeper from this space a connection that transcends the transactional an impact that lasts beyond the latest trend Maybe this reflection this exploration of what lies beyond the immediate can resonate with those who feel the same So to those whove walked this journey with me the adventure isnt stopping,1,0,1,1,1

It is my theory that during the decentralization the new staff they hired may have been experts in web3 but they failed to understand what makes Hedera different than every other ledger The inherent advantages of Hashgraph and what it does well are the native services but the apparent marketeveryone who could kickstart early development and build a thriving ecosystem got here building smart contracts onchain Endretail users AND enterprise are the main users of the native services but a hefty portion of smalltomedium businesses on Hedera do not have the public trust to operate without questionably trustworthy onchain executables EVM development shows a disconnect between shortterm growth the ultimate goal of Hedera to be enterprisegrade Enterprise web3 should not use smart contracts Literally why should they? Give me one good reason Has anyone asked that question? Enterprise applications should be operated by a server or a trusted array of servers using information from the network or sending information to the network to execute actions on chain or not to take advantage of the efficiency transparency or trust of the ledger in their operations or work flow The advantages of Hedera are its efficiency total ordering and native token programmability That is all you need If you are an end user you are using mostly tokens If you are interacting through a smalltomedium size business or decentralized intermediary in the larger web3 economy you probably need a contract Hedera is different though Truly pioneering a new way to build trustless systems with maximum efficiency EVM development is shortsighted and a poor market fit Thank you for coming to my TED Talk,0,1,0,1,1

Ten Key Considerations to Ensure OnChain Security in Web3 As blockchain technology continues to be applied across industries such as finance healthcare logistics and energy its security has garnered increasing attention Although blockchain is trusted for its decentralization transparency and immutability this does not imply it is completely immune to security threats With technological advancements hackers and malicious actors are finding new ways to attack blockchain systems Ensuring blockchain security is not just a technical issue it is the cornerstone of the industrys sustainable development In this article the ChainSource Security Team will explore ten critical considerations for ensuring blockchain security alongside specific case studies realworld applications and future trends 1 Encryption The Foundation of Blockchain Security Encryption is a fundamental means of protecting blockchain networks and data Each transaction within a blockchain uses complex encryption algorithms to safeguard data integrity and privacy Common encryption methods include symmetric and asymmetric encryption For instance the Bitcoin network uses the SHA256 encryption algorithm to secure transactions This algorithm is widely applied in various blockchain projects However as quantum computing technology advances existing encryption algorithms may face new challenges Quantum computers could potentially break current encryption mechanisms necessitating the development of quantumresistant encryption algorithms to ensure blockchain systems remain secure against quantum attacks 2 Private Keys Guardians of Blockchain Accounts In the blockchain world a private key is the sole credential to access a users account Whether it is Bitcoin Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies the security of private keys is paramount If a private key is lost or stolen it can be nearly impossible for users to recover their assets Therefore securely storing private keys is the top concern for blockchain users Cold storage is an effective method for storing private keys where the keys are kept on devices isolated from the internet to avoid the risk of network attacks Hardware wallets are a common tool for cold storage offering high levels of security Additionally users can enhance the protection of their private keys through multisignature mechanisms where multiple keys are required to authorize a transaction reducing the risk posed by a single key theft 3 Consensus Protocols The Core Mechanism for Network Security Blockchain networks rely on consensus protocols to ensure all participants agree on transaction data Different consensus mechanisms vary in efficiency security and decentralization Proof of Work PoW Proof of Stake PoS and Delegated Proof of Stake DPoS are the most commonly used consensus mechanisms today A notable example is Ethereums transition from PoW to PoS which not only improved the networks energy efficiency but also enhanced security In a PoW system an attacker would need more than 51 of the computing power to alter the blockchain while in a PoS system an attacker must hold a significant amount of cryptocurrency thus raising the cost of an attack However with the rise of PoS and other new consensus mechanisms new security issues have emerged such as the Nothing at Stake problem and longrange attacks which require further technological innovation to address 4 Immutable Ledger The Cornerstone of Blockchain Security One of blockchains most notable features is its immutability Once data is recorded on the blockchain it cannot be altered or deleted making blockchain an ideal tool for storing financial data medical records and other sensitive information For example in 2024 global logistics giant Amazon partnered with a blockchain company to launch a blockchainbased transparent supply chain management system By using blockchain to track the origin transportation routes and delivery times of goods Amazon ensured that every node in its supply chain was authentic and immutable thus improving transparency and efficiency This provides a strong demonstration of blockchains application for other global enterprises However while blockchain data itself is immutable security issues in peripheral systems remain Smart contract vulnerabilities key management errors or security risks in centralized exchanges can all compromise blockchain data security Therefore securing the entire ecosystem is crucial 5 Cybersecurity The First Line of Defense for Blockchain Ecosystems Blockchain cybersecurity protection involves multiple layers including firewalls intrusion detection systems and endpoint protection In recent years the methods used to attack blockchain networks have become increasingly diverse such as Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks and malware attacks threatening the security and stability of networks The Ethereum DAO incident is a wellknown case where hackers exploited a vulnerability in the DAOs smart contract to steal over 50 million in Ether This attack highlighted the immense risks posed by smart contracts that have not undergone thorough security audits To prevent similar incidents many blockchain projects have strengthened the auditing processes for smart contracts while introducing more cybersecurity measures With the adoption of emerging technologies such as 5G and the Internet of Things IoT the security needs of blockchain networks will become more complex Therefore the deep integration of blockchain with the field of cybersecurity will be key to ensuring technological security 6 Smart Contract Security Risks and Mitigations in Automated Processes Smart contracts have introduced endless possibilities for blockchain applications by enabling automated transactions without human intervention However vulnerabilities in smart contract code also provide opportunities for hackers As seen in the Ethereum DAO incident the security of smart contracts directly impacts the success of blockchain projects To ensure the security of smart contracts developers need to perform comprehensive code audits to identify potential vulnerabilities Tools such as formal verification can be used to ensure the correctness and safety of smart contract logic For example blockchain security firms like CertiK have provided smart contract security audits for various projects effectively preventing multiple potential attacks 7 Token Security Critical Protection for Digital Assets Tokens have become an important form of digital assets in blockchain development However managing and protecting tokens presents new security challenges Centralized exchanges are often targeted by hackers attempting to steal large amounts of tokens In October 2023 CoinEx a wellknown centralized exchange was hacked resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in tokens The hacker successfully stole assets by infiltrating the exchanges hot wallets While CoinEx quickly froze some accounts and promised compensation to users the incident highlighted the vulnerabilities of centralized exchanges in asset security To address this more users are turning to decentralized exchanges DEXs as they do not require custody of user assets reducing the risk of centralized attacks Additionally hardware wallets and multisignature technology have become vital tools for ensuring token security 8 Regulatory Compliance The Importance of KYC and AML Blockchain projects must comply with relevant regulations particularly in the financial sector Know Your Customer KYC and AntiMoney Laundering AML procedures are essential tools for preventing illegal activities By enforcing strict identity verification processes companies can ensure that transactions on their platforms are legitimate reducing the risk of crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing 9 Risk Assessment Identifying and Managing Potential Threats Risk assessment is a crucial step in ensuring blockchain security While blockchain offers decentralization transparency and immutability it is not immune to security threats Regular comprehensive risk assessments help identify existing system vulnerabilities and predict future security challenges allowing businesses to proactively address potential issues In the blockchain ecosystem security threats can arise from various levels including consensus mechanism design flaws smart contract coding errors private key management oversights and networklevel attacks 10 Continuous Monitoring and Testing A Longterm Mechanism for Blockchain Security Blockchain security is not a onetime solution it requires continuous monitoring and testing to maintain Given blockchains transparency all participants can access its data meaning that any existing system vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors Therefore ongoing penetration testing security assessments and code audits are essential Conclusion These ten key considerations for blockchain security reveal the complexity behind this emerging technology and the security challenges it faces While blockchain is known for decentralization transparency and immutability it is not unbreakable With the evolution of blockchain technology we can anticipate further breakthroughs in the field of security About PandaLY PandaLY is a company focused on blockchain

The Future of Privacy in Web3 COTI Networks Innovative Approach Alright folks lets talk about something thats not just exciting but crucialprivacy in Web3 I know Web3 is buzzing everywhere with promises of decentralization ownership and freedom But heres the thing If privacy doesnt evolve alongside these new technologies are we really better off? Thats where COTI Network steps in with an approach that goes beyond just slapping encryption on things COTI is laying the groundwork for a future where privacy isnt just a featureits the backbone of how we interact on Web3 ### Why Privacy Matters More Than Ever In Web2 platforms like Google and Facebook made fortunes off your data You click you scroll you buy and they collect and monetize But Web3 promised us something different control over our identities transactions and data The problem is many blockchain networks still expose too much informationwallet balances transaction historiesright out in the open Imagine using Ethereum and everyone can see exactly how much ETH you own Thats like having your bank account statement on a billboard Not exactly what Id call freedom With Web3 evolving rapidly protecting our privacy becomes more critical We need privacy not just for security but also for freedom of choice without fear of surveillance or manipulation ### COTIs Unique Approach to Privacy Now COTI Network is doing something different from the pack While many networks focus solely on anonymity or zeroknowledge proofs which are amazing dont get me wrong COTI takes a multilayered approach At its core COTI believes that privacy and trust should go hand in hand Heres a breakdown of how theyre shaking things up 1 PrivacyGuardia This tool part of COTIs ecosystem ensures that sensitive information doesnt spill over where it shouldnt It gives users the ability to control their data exposure meaning you can interact onchain while still deciding what remains private and what goes public 2 Lava Network Collaboration With COTI V2 expanding into areas like the Lava Network which ensures data privacy for blockchain communication COTI is building a seamless pipeline for secure private transactions You get the benefits of decentralization without sacrificing privacy 3 ZNS CONNECT COTIs involvement in identity management means users can move through different decentralized platforms without leaking sensitive information This approach allows for interoperability while keeping data confidential Its like having a passport that doesnt give away all your personal history every time you use it 4 Carbon Browser Many browsers today track every click and keystroke COTI is pushing forward with Carbon Browser ensuring private and encrypted web interactions without sacrificing speed and functionality Now you can surf the Web3 world without leaving behind a trail ### Why This Matters for the Future Look privacy is no longer a nicetohave Its a necessity As we shift more of our livesour finances communications and identitiesinto Web3 we need solutions like COTIs that balance privacy and trust The big win here isnt just being invisibleits about controlling what you share and when you share it Thats real empowerment COTIs focus on both transactional privacy and identity protection sets it apart This isnt just about keeping things hidden Its about building a network where people can trust the system AND each other without exposing everything they do ### Final Thoughts So heres the bottom line folks The future of Web3 isnt just about decentralization Its about building systems that respect and protect our right to privacy COTI Network is leading the charge not with empty promises but with real practical solutions Its not just about being a part of Web3its about shaping it into a space where privacy is a right not an afterthought As we move forward keep an eye on projects like COTI Theyre not just building for the nowtheyre designing for the future And in that future privacy wont be something we fight foritll be something we take for granted Lets build that future together,1,0,0,1,1

Galacticas Identity Virtual Machine IVM Lets take a look at two key unique selling points 1 PrivacyCentric Computation The IVM allows for computations on encrypted data without needing to expose the data itself This is pivotal in the Web3 environment where most blockchain operations are transparent and public Privacy Preservation Unlike traditional systems where using data typically means revealing it IVM enables the use of personal data for various applications like reputation scores or personalized services without compromising privacy This is achieved through advanced cryptographic techniques like zeroknowledge proofs ZK and fully homomorphic encryption FHE This feature allows for compliance with data protection regulations while still leveraging the data for computational needs which is crucial for applications in finance healthcare and personal datadriven services 2 Web3 Reputation Systems IVM supports the creation of comprehensive reputation systems in Web3 which can account for both positive and negative user actions This system goes beyond simple transaction histories to provide a nuanced view of a users digital footprint Enhanced Trust in Decentralized Systems In decentralized finance DeFi or any peertopeer interaction trust can be quantified and dynamically adjusted based on a users actions This allows for more refined user interactions like tailored loan terms based on ones digital reputation reducing the reliance on onesizefitsall collateral requirements Holistic User Assessment By considering both positive and negative behaviors the IVM offers a more balanced and fair approach to user reputation which can discourage malicious activities while promoting positive engagement within the ecosystem #Galactica USER GNET galacticacomnewsgalactica,1,0,0,1,0

Why wouldnt they exist thoe ? Its just that people raised too little at nft mint for too large ambition and that is more of a business decisionmishap Dont look at from a web3 what happened in 2021 world thats exactly what I pointed so I am curious to hear ur thoughts on I say this as an Angel investor myself Think of this as a regular business fund raising building pov Of raising more money from the nft mint itself to have all the funds to build out what you want to began with sell nfts for a higher price at mint and if the idea is that wouldnt work means the product isnt juicy enough for people to buy Collectibles and utility ecosystems at some point have to decouple  we try to do it opposite of building collectibles in this space and that doesnt work So having based business models on royalties was a massive delusion we all accepted I say we including myself that was wrong to began with,0,1,0,1,0

Just a thought essay sorry on the still here thing in web3 There are many people still here not bc they want to engage in the grind to strive relentlessly to be seen or acknowledged by people with influence or within the web3 space They are here bc of a stillclungto interest in excitement for a stillinteresting exciting suite of tools to share provide provenance for their work in the case of artists the future potential for a wider audience to engage with collect it in new ways Personally Im in the latter camp I just want to make work in various media hence why digital ownership feels great to me follow the muse wherever it goes mint the stuff I feel deserves it leave the cards to fall where they may I only control my output for better or worse I realise I am one of the lucky ones bc I can view wide adoption of digital ownership through a hopeful future lens  I still work on stuff I love in the poster commercial fields I am still fulfilled creatively well Im not but thats another story never will be  I am fortunate bc I was well placed to survive nb not unscathed the mental rollercoaster bc I have a diverse output a fair amount of experience already have the scars D But in that I do have a a bit of friendly advice for artists in the web3 space Realistically at the moment it is not a viable source of income for most Its a bonus at best We all know for a while in 202022 it seemed like the ultimate source that creativity was really going to be highly valued at last especially with royalties it was a great time peakdreaming our digital future looked so bright but we were completely blinded by the light it was an unsustainable unrealistic bubble fuelled by a pandemic we are still in the fall out A good part is we are waking up to the fact that a digital life has to be balanced or outweighed in fact by as good healthy a real one as we can muster circumstances allowing I do believe personally that it has a future will evolve into something v exciting  But for now I would suggest diversify  Either with other applications for your art or finding another source of income that allows you the headspace for your art Learn new skills bc while our AI future might make some of them defunct being multiskilled adaptable imo makes you bestplaced to continue surviving as a creative But also imo do what you can to ensure you dont have to rely on web3 some of its lessappealing aspects like grinding for a living The dream is still here But its best enjoyed for its potential all the better when your focus is on the work and what these tools mean for it rather than feeling you have to be in with this person or that Im sorry that Im unable to do a take on social media without it being an essay D But these thoughts are rattling in my brain as always posted with good intentions in the hope they help someone Its tough out there you need your energy you need to apply it in the right places keep it lit MattGriff still here,1,0,0,1,1

What are your thoughts on Web3 marketing? Its unfortunate that many people view marketing simply as creating advertisements exposing them through various channels managing social media utilizing key opinion leaders KOLs organizing events and at most managing the resulting data In the Web3 market it seems that many people think this way because there hasnt been as much focus on marketing strategies as there has been on technological development Even some marketing agencies fall into this trap Approaches that are solely focused on making money are likely to face increasing criticism from the public While the definition and scope of marketing may vary from person to person the marketing I learned is about continuously pondering answering implementing and refining the question How do we deliver core value to the customer? If we call marketing merely following functional actions that others do without this fundamental consideration it might appear as something anyone can do Builders need to create core value while marketers need to consider how to deliver that core value to customers If either of these aspects fails the message wont be effectively conveyed to customers Examples of this failure include trying to present something as having core value when it doesnt or having core value but not understanding what it is and simply spending money on marketing efforts Web3 marketing is no different Good builders and good marketers should respect each others roles as partners They should discuss what the core value is that they want to deliver to customers and how best to deliver it,0,1,0,1,0

The biggest mistake people make with DeFi and how to avoid it A founders perspective Lets talk about the state of Web3 in 2024 Weve come so far yet weve just scratched the surface of whats possible As a founder in this space for years I want to share thoughts on where we are and where were headed The early days of DeFi a bit felt like magic We became our own banks traded without middlemen and accessed global financial tools from anywhere The promise was immense and weve largely delivered on it DeFis TVL skyrocketed to 185B by mid2024 Thats not just growth its a paradigm shift Weve seen innovative protocols rise from AMMs to liquid staking derivatives each pushing the boundaries of finance But it hasnt all been smooth sailing As the industry matured we faced challenges 1 Fragmentation The multichain reality has led to a fragmented landscape Its become really painintheass sorts difficult to track opportunities across 100s of different protocols and chains 2 Complexity The learning curve for DeFi is steep I have seen a few degens from DeFi Summer 10 struggling to keep up with the latest protocols and strategies 3 Inefficiency Moving assets between chains dealing with gas fees managing multiple wallets the dropdown list in wallets is overloaded and often frustrating 4 Security As TVL grew so did the incentive for attacks Weve seen too many hacks and exploits eroding trust in the system were building These arent just minor inconveniences theyre significant barriers to mainstream adoption And thats what keeps me up at night apart from the bad sleep schedule how can we bring the benefits of Web3 to a bigger user base? In the early days of DeFi we saw tothemoon APYs that seemed too good to be true and often they were But as the market matured weve seen a shift towards more sustainable still attractiveish yields Interestingly as of 2024 the lending market accounts for a significant portion of DeFis TVL Theyve become a cornerstone of DeFi offering users the ability to earn passive income on their assets Whats interesting is how yields have evolved Were no longer seeing the crazy fourdigit APYs of the past Instead users are gravitating towards more stable longterm opportunities LSTs now LRTs emerged as a popular choice offering a way to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity But heres the catch finding and accessing these opportunities isnt always straightforward Users often have to navigate multiple platforms deal with different chains and constantly monitor their positions Its a fulltime job just to stay on top of the best opportunities! This brings me to what I believe is the next crucial phase in Web3s evolution We need to focus on three key areas 1 Integration We need to connect different protocols and chains under the same roof to create a smooth user experience 2 Simplification The power of DeFi and onchain gains should be accessible to everyone not a bunch of degens their friends 3 Security We must prioritize user safety by building rugproof products without compromising the ethos of decentralization This vision has been driving me and our team and weve been working tirelessly on a solution that we believe will address these challenges headon Im excited to give you a sneak peek into what weve been building Presenting USER a platform that aims to revolutionize how we interact onchain A world where you dont have to worry about which chain youre on where complex farming strategies are just a click away and where your assets are always working hard for you automatically finding the best farming opportunity across the entire DeFi landscape Thats the future were building with Alloc8 Its not just another DeFi protocol its a new paradigm for interacting with Web3 In the coming weeks Ill be sharing more details about USER including some features that we believe will change the game Follow to stay updated and get ready to experience Web3 in a new way The future is integrated efficient and fully onchain And were just getting started,1,0,1,1,0

My thoughts on Crypto BD Background I have been a protocol dev a CMO and now a BD guy 1 Before web3 BD was a position held by Tier1 MBA grads There were 2 ways to be one a be exceptionally good academically since kindergarten MBA schools turn successful people into successful people b old money 2 Web3 got 1825yos into BD a We have two types of Crypto BD folks A position that required Sales intensive researchdriven strategy increasing key metrics like ARR and multidomain growth handled by a young kid who can meme This was because very few understood core degen crypto and that knowledge made the cut b Misfits Outliers round pegs in the square holes Those who HBS would never accept People who experiment and selflearn The passion that is sidelines by the traditional education system and cooperates ladders Crypto and Web3 opened a domain for permissionless crossborder anon employmentthe Hustlers BD gets a bad picture because there is not enough work In general In crypto For 99 of the projects Country BD head of a L2L1 meeting projects who want to apply for grants You have no power to approve grants Your foundation heads will review things What do you do? You go to parties and meet the same projects every time MOSTLY So advice for Web3 projects behave like a web2 company Derive conclusions from USER and other reports Give a subscription to USER to your BD team Create a culture of strategy and research Delegate quarterly result ownership Listen to them and give them control to do things BD is a big strategy sales position in any other Web2 company What chief of engineering is to the CTO BD is to the CEO,0,1,0,1,0

Random thought on Web3 Gaming When people think of Web3 games the first thing that comes to mind is the ability to own ingame items on the blockchain But is this really the issue that concerns gamers? I dont think so Another common belief is that we need a AAA game that is genuinely engaging to play However the production timelines for such games span 410 years Meanwhile development tools are rapidly improving allowing smaller developers to create indie games This brings fresh ideas into the market but due to competition often prevents them from developing into something big Success requires scale marketing and money especially for freemium model games small development teams may not sustain without a budget Many forget that cryptocurrency at its core is a financial sphere Its greatest strength has been the ability to quickly move money regardless of geography particularly in raising funds to finance projects Thus one of the most optimal uses of crypto in my opinion is funding games and distributing revenue among investors A Web25 Example Imagine a platform similar to Steam with the following features For Players Game presentation similar to Steam Accepting payments from different countries For Game Developers Organizing and accepting investments for game creators in USDT from anywhere in the world Transferring funds to developers Monitoring developers commitments payments are made in stages as development progresses Converting player payments Distributing shares among participants It could have been done by IMX USER A small group of developers uploads a demo game on the platform introduces themselves explains the games lore identifies its niche They receive investments and in addition to funding can also get marketing and outsourcing services from investors who are equally interested in the games success Players in turn get a greater variety of midscale gaming experiences This is just a concept that might look different in practice but The basic idea is that there is no need for players to have the solutions that web3 gaming developers are now trying to do now Anyway I wonder what will happen next in this sector I suggest you follow USER and DAO participants Check the following theyre the best in the sector,1,0,0,1,0

Seems like that Jigen exactly knows where the conviction should be layed on I personally have the same thoughts and do believe that gaming will be the new meta to onboarding the web2 masses towards web3 Simple reason is people love playing games we in web3 love earning and what do we get? PlayToEarn as simple as that good story with good graphics and a simple mechanism to earn money while playing is in my opinion what will be changing the meta in upcoming years for web3,1,0,0,1,0

Did you ever think whats next trend in #web3? We believe the next tech solution that blows our minds will be a personal #blockchain Everyone will get their blockchain any communication with an outside person or business will create yet another independent chain Person A builds their chain when this person buys something in a bakery Business A this action creates a new chain with two transactions sending funds and receiving the cake And all of these #blockchains will be witness chains such as YARchain Because we dont need such many absolutely the same but still separated blockchains We need to improve the level of freedom for each participant in our #ecosystem from local to global area without cutting freedom in other participants We need a balance of freedom Its a whole new level of privacy in the open world Person A builds relationships with family friends cooperatives companies governments etc And each brand new connection its a brand new chain in the global chains ecosystem Each global ecosystem entity is the Chosen One Utopia dont you? But we should clearly understand that Witness Chains its the future of web3 and YARchain its just the first bird that improves and standardizes this area for future public and private solutions that will be bridged by YARchain because YARchain will support all chains existing and new One day we will announce the launch of the global scoring system and that help all of us to make web3 much closer than ever before The era of skills will launch from building a bridge from the era of instruments to the uncompromised respect for property rights on personal time thoughts data and #assets The future starts every single second,1,0,0,1,0

A thought on all these payouts you are seeing on the timeline from the people who farmed USER and USER I think it is awesome In my opinion this one of the key features and benefits in what Web3 is supposed to be How would these two entities have gotten the word out about their brands traditionally? They would have paid for ads on X Meta etc Social media ads dont annoy you? They would have paid google for keyword searches Scrolling through sponsored ads doesnt annoy you? The process needs refinement for sure but because the blockchain allows for peertopeer microtransactions it also allows brands to skip middlemen like Google and Meta Instead they can pay YOU to market for them Bonus most of you are also part of their target market audience So now their marketers are also their consumers USER is another perfect example Their consumers are also their marketers And they reward their consumer for helping them grow their brand Beautiful Now watch how we do it next,1,0,0,1,0

Ive spent a good amount of time on Lens and Farcaster and here are my thoughts 1 First things first Lens and Warpcast arent where youll find your family or close friends These platforms are more about connecting with people in the web3 space or following creators youre interested in This is a big difference from Instagram or Twitter where we go for fun Ive leaned more towards Warpcast instead of Twitter in the last two years because it felt like a community where I could share my work get feedback and connect with a smaller more engaged group of people But lately as its turned into more of a place for constant shilling its not been as enjoyable for me 2 The UI of these platforms are not as userfriendly as the apps were used to and the whole system feels more complicated This makes it harder for web2 folks who are used to simpler apps to see any reason to join Lens or Farcaster I see these being restricted to web3 and tech folks 3 Knowing now that these arent your typical social media apps lets talk about who actually uses them and why Most of us got into Farcaster coz decentralisation and web3 features the network effect from being early and the sense of community But as the platform grew it seems like the benefits and the community feel have changed Talking to other longtime users the sentiment is similar the early benefits like special NFTs and tokens are now less exclusive and the community vibe has shifted With an increase in spam and tactics weve tried to avoid adapting to these changes hasnt been fun especially with all the new strategies to game the system that have followed us here 4 FC doesnt feel the same anymore it doesnt feel like a place where anyone can build their own FC client and get Dan to retweet it Everyone there is competing for attention selling something or trying to get Dan and Jesse Pollak to notice them I cant identify between bots and real users anymore and my feed is full of people shilling who I dont know To sum it up theres no sense of community for me too many bots too much frame noise less diversity in what content gets picked by algo and Im not having fun anymore I guess its great Dan shipped all those features and go so many new users but I think itll be at the cost of the older ones leaving or becoming more dormant over time,0,1,1,1,1

Some thoughts around new devs leaving the space and the rise and fall of onboarding web2 devs meta Most of 2022 a lot of companies and projects focused on educating people building a community and bringing web2 folks to web3 There were big projects securing funding for this stuff and it really looked very promising Until it was not Every company started educating people and I am absolutely up for that I have done my fair share of work in the same area with Alchemy University I am still AUs biggest supporter even today but the issue is not the courses or the projects themselves Its a mix of target audience and what they were targeted for The core issue itself was the steep learning curve multiple languages their intricacies different tools and the students who were new to coding let alone web3 itself 1 Firstly web3 changes every week Literally every week and students coming to web3 dont understand this meta As soon as they grasp rollups its zk time 2 Then we can look at every ecosystem If we talk about major one of those you can see that there are so many things to learn that students can get overwhelmed Learn solidity hardhat foundry JSTS then there is rust mafia golang centric companies cairo rollups zkWasm zkEVM Someone less than a year into web3 cant track all of it and they lose self confidence 3 Solidity itself has a bit of learning curve for people who have not coded much in JavaScriptC or any another similar language Then using hardhat vs foundry and writing tests and scripts can be something hard for new devs 4 Resources VS outcome Every company starting with education platform had good intentions behind it They wanted to onboard devs but they also wanted the devs to use their services Projects were not seeing a decent outcome for the resources they were putting in This makes them want to look for other ideas to implement 5 Community doesnt stick Sooner or later once student finishes a course they leave that community in hunt of a job or freelance work or bounties I mean the ultimate goal for these devs to onboard in web3 is to make money right? So this brings me to my last point 6 Bear market and junior engineers A lot of these devs coming in are new devs with less than 1 year of professional experience We were in bear market and companies would want to focus on building stuff at as low spending as possible We are in web3 companies also prefer senior devs because of security reasons on No one wants to get hacked or be laurences next target So naturally these new devs were not hired or didnt get freelance gigs They did not get what they were told or promised by their peers or from any youtube video So they left,0,1,1,1,1

Dont build FOR the community Build WITH the community Many founders are geniuses so they build projects based on their thoughts rather than real feedback from people This kills thousands of Web3 projects because the community wants a slightly different use case than the executive team provides One of the best sources of ideas for improving your product is your users Give your audience a chance to show you how they want to use the product and explore that sometimes you may find that your idea is cool but they dont use it the way you intended This signals to focus your efforts on developing the features your users want,1,0,0,1,0

Not every project is building a AAA game but for those who aspire to It can take years to deliver a quality game Add to the fact that this is all being built on new tech These studios are pioneering the space right now Funding Imagine you could build a AAA game for 2m Sorry to disappoint You cant! Want a game with highend graphics extensive gameplay and quality gaming mechanics? Were looking in the 10s of millions Marketing As good as a game may be Without a proven track record its naive to think marketing is irrelevant Marketing is crucial!

I wanna discuss something with my Web3 friends Whats your thoughts on royalties on secondary sales? It really seems like these days people are not fans of it and I dont understand why For example the trending project USER is taking 0 royalties on secondary sales And people think its amazing But I wonder shouldnt these artists who absolutely work their butt off on the art or the project itself be rewarded? I suppose I understand if people are ripping off projects or creating projects quickly and putting up a 7 royalty thinking theyll get rich overnight Thats lame But if people create projects of actual value whether art or utility NFT projects shouldnt they be allowed to profit from it without people losing their mind? What are your thoughts on this? Is there a percentage royalty you support? While royalties cant be the only thing you make money on in Web3 these days I think its fair for you to do so Lets chat about it Would love to see your comments Also again kudos to #notdead1974 And its early success!

There are some silent shifts that are currently happening in web3 Among many other things one of them is the way content is done Heres my thoughts on it 1 The language of trust As this space grows up people are getting pickier with the projects they get into They want to be sure that theyre reliable and that teams are keen to deliver to their community Copywriters need to show transparency and reliability through their words Its not just about what a project does Its also about the integrity behind it about being honest Example communicating the changes going on in the project what worked well and what didnt 2 Storytelling with purpose Storytelling has always been a powerful tool But rather than simply telling a story for the sake of engagement it can be used to explain the projects mission Example a masterpiece when it comes to storytelling with NFTs is USER 3 Authenticity over hype Authenticity is gold in web3 Theres no more place for projects producing hype Content should focus more on showing what the project has done and what its working on Users want projects that match their values and do what they say 4 Nurturing communities with words Copywriting in this space goes beyond X content websites and newsletters Its about connecting with the community making people feel part of something Its all about trust being real being clear including everyone telling a good story This is how projects connect with people and give power to their users Content creators such as USER or USER who are using these tricks are the most valuable resources 5 Clarity in complexity Projects sometimes deal with tricky tech words But good content can simplify these hard ideas The change happening here is about making web3 words more welcoming to everyone Its no longer just about mere words but about creating connections telling meaningful stories making people feel like being part of a movement,1,0,0,1,0

They are somewhat similar But CS and TF2 where good games first and then built an economy second These games simply sell you a representation of something half of the time it isnt even a thing that appears ingame at ridiculous prices off the bat You arent buying an unusual hat from another player who priced it at 80 bucks because it is in extreme demand and people are already interested in getting it which is either unobtainable trough any other means andor has a score tracker with 120000 points recorded Youre buying a token from the devs at 1000 bucks because it has value look at the number we tacked onto it!

This is a good example of the real core of the splinterlands community Decent people who enjoy collectible card games Sadly many have left because of the way things have gone however I still play and enjoy it and I know that I wanted the progress and the tokens and the experimentation even if they spoiled things I wanted to see web3 tested to its full and flexed and expanded on and I kinda still do Who knows whether anything good will ever come of it But thats why we experiment right! I just wish that people had a better perspective on what theyre getting in to because its horrible watching people lose money and get super burned and salty The splinterlands team definitely never wanted to see that happen even if they are responsible for it Its just new tech out of control hyped to the max and susceptible to all the usual human weaknesses Im still a part of it and still intrigued to see what comes next or how it all ends!,1,1,1,1,0

 Were talking about different things I see For purposes of criminal enforcement against individuals yes they have some issues but criminal action against corporate or communal entities doesnt actually care about any of this and will levy fines just fine and dandy against the DAO Notwithstanding that the SEC has been perfectly happy to pursue most crypto matters short of fraud without threat of jail time This is where strict liability plays in if the treasury cant handle the fines then every single member of the group is liable for the shortfall split roughly evenly In contrast shareholders in a company are well not liable at all if a corporation has committed crimes theyre just owners not administrators whereas a DAO isnt well anything legally but if you take them at their word then participants in a DAO are theoretically all working towards a goal,0,1,0,0,1

Interestingly as a splinterlands player I thought this was a pretty cool stat Crypto was always an investment thing no matter how much people try to NFA everything they say and then web3 gaming was supposed to make it more fun so the fact that those two key words are used almost the same number of times seems like an accurate representation of what we were all in it for Im not ashamed of that I thought it was a cool idea I guess I just briefly forgot that humans are constantly ruining everything and that no concept will ever negate the human condition I cant wait for the next cool idea Ill be straight in there ruining it along with everyone else Thats how we do progress!,1,1,1,1,0

xu8dp The metaverse simply had no reason to exist in the first place Theres no point in any game being on it because game developers have no motivation to make their games compatible with it trying to make the game compatiable with it will pretty much universally make the game worse as a result if people can use their own graphics then it wont fit with the games graphics and if theres anything at all that affects gameplay that would be an immediate no go For any store its just worse than a website searching for things is harder and you still cant see the actual physical product and still have to deal with shipping so whats even the point? It wouldnt matter if all the companies trying to create their own version had worked together or not because theres simply no motivation for anyone to add their products to it in the first place Everything that could be there would be better off hosting their own servers where they have better control over the user experience than by tacking it onto whatever metaverse because its ultimately pretty much just taking the worst aspects of the real world and the worst aspects of being online and putting them together without any of the good aspects of them,0,1,1,0,0
 There are a lot of videos to explain it in more detail such as People Make Games channel but in a nutshell Roblox only pays 10 of the earnings you make while they take the 90 If you earn 100 you only take 10 Roblox is putting sugarcoats on it like Marketplace Fees and all that to brainwash young developers who dont know better but if you remove those sugarcoats its horrible Plus Roblox has the full rights to remove your entire game your entire work and your account and your money on the platform if you even dare to speak against them They do even sue you if they feel like it Lethal Company is supposed to be a Roblox game but the dev got fed up with Robloxs mismanagement and decided to build his game on a real game engine and release it on Steam Roblox brainwashed devs hate him but everyone outside of Roblox loves him Same as Unturned and the devs behind it Again there are a lot of videos that go into full details about this This is just the surface,0,0,1,0,1

Also even if someone did create a game comparable to WoW in its early days which I very strongly doubt is the case here anyway but Ive never played either game and for the sake of argument if I pretended that it were WoW in its early days would not be successful today It was successful at the time because it was more or less the first of its kind and people didnt have alternatives at the time now that people do have alternatives you need to make a game thats better than the alternatives to stand a chance just making more of the same would never be successful and its way easier to copy a games mechanics than is it to come up with it in the first place so its not any measure of developer competence to be able to make a clone of an old game,0,1,0,0,0
But I was told that this was all revolutionary because you actually owned your digital assets So funny how the supposed ideal use case of crypto games you own all your items and the devs cant take them from you!! turns out to be bullshit because the devs apparently still have full control over their distribution and also crypto games are all guaranteed to die eventually and since they are almost all always online maximum socialdependency games made to incentivize spending you dont even get to use the items at all once the rug is pulled,0,1,1,0,0
 you are missing the point dude in the blockchain world you only have whats inside your wallet if you go to a game and deposit your axe on it you actually loose your rights over the axe and its not longer yours But lets say you never deposit the axe in the game so you never transfer your rights over the item then WHATEVER happen your axe will still be in your wallet and be yours Meaning if you are stupid enough to give up your right over your item or whatever in real life then you deserve whatever will happen to you When they say crazy programmer hold our code hostage that mean the project was ass in the first place and im a programmer myself Either its because the programmer and the project manager agreed for a system where the programmer get paid when he reach programming goals but the project manager didnt paid him like it was agreed so its the project manager fault Either its because the project manager didnt managed sht and never made what he had to do after paying the project to secure the project manager fault again BUT if the project manager change the databaseserver and whatever service they use password put the code in a private repository and ask for a second look over the code to another programmer to be sure not backdoor were implemented or things like that theres absolutely 100 chances that NEVER a programmer can hold whatever code hostage You know whats the crazy shit? Often a company will tell you we are poor so lets pay you from our future benefice and because you trust the project you will actually code it and trust them Then they will not pay you the amount said or a dime even if they are making a lot of profit those sames lame peoples will then ask you to review parts of the code to implement things there and there I believe thats actually the moment somes programmer would say fck it pay me or i delete EVERYTHING somes company are so stupid they dont even have backups,0,1,1,0,1
So a fun story about the reputation of crypto bro in 2016 steam allow payment by bitcoin and wanted to expand to others currencies trying to cash out on the last hype at the time They stoped doing that in 2017 for three reason transaction fees was too High and was taking a bigger cut in profit than expected fluctuation could make a game cost 10 dollars one Day 100 the next one but most important the incident rate in payment on steam is expected to be at upper most of 10 So I quote the famous newell on this We had problems when we started accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment option 50 of those transactions were fraudulent which is a mindboggling number These were customers we didnt want to have He also add that the crypto space is populated with actors that are not people you want interacting with your customers So yeah no Wonder they dont have the best reputation I wouldnt expect devs to trust them even a little bit,0,1,0,0,1

 would say none are trying to be a good game since their design philosophy is backwards to begin with as Juawn has shown numerous times They put the burden of development cost on the consumer They design with investor first rather then actual fun gameplay in mind and the quality usually isnt good or unoptimized since they just grab whatever assets they can find even though they raise as much capital as a lower to mid range AAA game does lol,0,1,1,0,0

 sorry to hear that it sounds frustrating It might still be valuable to consider some of the highlevel ideals of the crypto ecosystem and how you might implement those without a blockchain Some of the broad concepts tied to crypto right now decentralization federated trust etc have merit for certain use cases but as mentioned in the video and in my comment you can often implement those in a better way without blockchains So you might be able to take some of what youve learned about crypto and apply it to other architectures to make something new and interesting that isnt tied to the issueshype of crypto stuff Mastodon is a good example of something newinteresting that feels similar to the promises of crypto but doesnt use cryptoblockchains to implement it,0,0,1,1,0

 I hadnt heard if it before but I just read through a bunch of docs and it sounds like just an evolution of the same intrinsic issues with all blockchain stuff we can achieve the same goals more easily efficiently and securely without using blockchains to do it Canisters sound like generic containers that package program logic That can be done on standard cloud platforms if we want to and wed get all the same benefits probably more benefits The main disconnect I see between the proponents of this stuff and reality is that decentralization is nowhere near the killer feature that blockchain enthusiasts claim it is Having some trust in who we do business withinteract with is not a terrible thing and it makes a lot of stuff simpler lol Also the ICP website makes ridiculously outlandish Web 3 claims about how great it is which is an immediate red flag haha It does sound very cool and sophisticated but its just not necessary or really beneficial as far as I can tell,0,1,0,0,1
There are many apps that are truly onchain only outside of the UI which anyone can replace and is not required to interact with the app Currently in the process of building a system design agencies can plug in to find jobs on a job board bid on jobs receive feedback manage their team structures all on the Ethereum chain You could create a job posting without using our UI although the UI is much more userfriendly It costs about 50 to post a job or create a team and as updates like sharding are introduced this cost will go down,1,0,0,1,0
The contracts you are describing that arent immutable are called proxy contracts and considered bad practice by anyone who cares about decentralization It is very easy to see when a project is using a proxy Your problem is focusing on what you see the main selling point of decentralization Everyone has there own and everyone is attempting to achieve that in different ways If your goal is to be financially decentralized replacing payment processors with crypto payments is the best way It makes sense that you the youtuber only cares about decentralized hardcontent storage Which could be achieved with onchain user profiles linked to ipfs nodes of your videos Then you have the problem that if youtube wants to unpin that node whenever they can But there is also nothing stopping you from pinning the node yourself to guarantee your content stays up There are also free pinning services available 5 years ago most of this would not have been possible and ipfs wouldnt exist if it werent for cryptoweb3 devs working towards decentralization The if its not perfect its worthless is a great way to discount the progress made,1,1,0,1,0
It was a nft contract on mainnet I literally helped a client deploy and it was about 33 eth at the time and eth was around 2k so yes a contract can be expensive Sure you can deploy your little side projects to polygon but most people want to buy and sell nft using eth and not some off chain crypto It does have some use cases but like you even said the price will come down is the response we always see but it havent come down Its a speculative market which means fake inflated prices Im not discrediting crypto Ive been able to pay people in other countries using crypto so it has good uses Im just saying there is a lot of hype around a tech that can easily be made with todays web technologies The issue is people always assume big corp is bad so we need to keep all data off of companies If the company is bad dont use them or make your own product In regards to your ipfs idea it makes sense but in reality even if I host my video links on the chain and have ipfs nodes who is going to watch them? Sure Ill have tons of videos no one can censor or remove but why if no one can easily browse for them? You need a lot of technical knowledge to browse the chain manually or you need a third party community to build a tool to find my videos then I need to convince people to download this third party tool so they can see my videos At that point we have reached a form of centralization again because someone owns and manages that tool If someone makes a website to help people find my videos again its owned by a single entity who can easily filter out my videos Its a good idea in theory but in practice its useless because having access to my videos isnt as important as allowing people to stumble upon my videos YouTube provides me a service by giving me access to viewers so I need to play by their rules At the end of the day the only argument I can find is for people trying to publish highly politically controversial videos or illegal videos,0,1,1,0,1
 An nft contract for 33eth had to be filled with bloatware unnecessary libs and interfaces old outdated openzeppelin contracts Even when eth was 3k I was deploying nft contracts on mainnet for 20 Many recently for 10 The contract Im currently working on w erc20 token governance job and bidding functionality contributer profiles w job history and team functionality with teamlevel governance is around the 2530 mark at the moment Takes some knowledge of the evm In regards to big corps having data Id rather all nonsensitive data be public access In regards to the ipfs idea if only one company has a UI for the video upload smart contract then yes thats an element of centralization But it would be very easy to make your own ui to view your content again or start a competing service There could also be many UIs for one video upload contract much like there are many UIs available for uniswap contracts A new erc standard could be made so there could be many platforms like there are for nfts or erc20 tokens The point is the possibilities with smartcontracts the argument that decentralization for a video platform is not a significant value add is different from the argument that we are going about decentralization the wrong way,0,1,0,1,0
 I still think you are 100 wrong about the price Send me your verified contract address for a erc721 The contract I deployed was an open zep nft contract the most basic one I could find so unless youre doing some really optimized approach I dont see how its possible Which provides my point that you need to be good at evm to even achieve the average dev wont be able to deploy a cheap contract Very easy to make your own ui Again this means someone needs to be a web dev to actually successfully use web3 Think about the average person who knows nothing about coding and tell them to decentralize their stuff its not feasible which means they will always rely on a third party centralized entity to help them Youre looking at all this web3 stuff as a dev hyped up on web3 instead think about it as a layman who has no tech experience,0,1,1,0,1

its impossible even if you get a company did everything right people still gonna complain that they can change the code because the code below to the company whats the point? ofcourse theres point cryptocurrency first came out is to fights inflation so first thing to make sure is that some company dont just create bounch of codes on their own and can delete coins on their own,0,1,1,0,0

Yes but ipfs is an actual good web3 use case Most of everything else in web3 is unnecessarily attached to a blockchain Although decentralization for storage isnt really solving a real issue that I can tell unless you live in Russia or china and want to download files the government doesnt want you to see But even so the government can block ip requests outside of their country so ipfs doesnt solve the big issues,0,1,0,0,1
 as a Russian I confirm Cryptocurrency is one of the easiest way to transfer money across the border we still can use banks of neutral countries as an alternative it just requires traveling there Btw even here its unappealing to keep money in crypto BTC price is decreasing and stablecoins are simply less reliable than cash Maybe even our banks are more reliable than stablecoins,0,1,0,0,1
I think the biggest useCase of decentralization is if you live in a country where communications are controlled strictly by the government or access to information is censored Imagine living in a country that doesnt allow you to read any Wikipedia articles Which there are like 12 Access to this information shouldnt be filtered by a government entity so a dApp could help users find and read the info they need But even so that is such a small use case and it doesnt reflect the millions of dollars poured into blockchain Its a simple problem that could be solved by a teenager programmer these days,0,1,0,1,0
The only thing that isnt centralized is the contractblockchainnetwork itself Everything built around it for the users to interact with ethereum will always be centralized The only way to be truly be decentralized is to host a ethereum node on your own machine and send transactions through it otherwise youre again dealing with a centralized RPC server which is taking your signed transactions and forwarding them to the blockchain There is always a middleman,0,1,0,0,1
Yes I believe you can sign and verify addresses using web3js So a user would need to include a signed string in the request and the backend would need to very it using web3ethaccountsrecover which would return the public address who signed that string That is how you could add wallet based authentication I believe although I havent done it myself,0,0,0,1,0
Right I think all of this tech has potential but right now today its not worth the massive amount of funding it currently has People are betting on technology that has little use at this point Not everything can be decentralized or needs to be Having a central authority has many benefits including if someone steals my credit card and spends 500 on it I can usually get that money back from their fraud department Good luck doing that with crypto Also for a NFT to be useful such as using a NFT for house titles you need a central service to enforce the meaning behind the NFT If the government doesnt respect the values of the smart contract its useless,0,1,0,0,1

So the reason why everything you said is right in the past but wrong currently This has been solved and is being implemented Cross game skins are a thing here is an excerpt explaining it better One major criticism NFTs face from gamers is that they cant serve as Crossgame Skins Sure one NFT can represent a skin file for one game but it can not be used in others Well they WERE right but today we have NFT 20 standards that solve this introducing ERC 5773,1,0,0,1,0
The main problem faced is games that can compete with AAA title Web2 games It will never happen if AAA developer companies start making Web3 games themselves Things like crossskin integration spanning all games Transaction fee money player retention because they are essentially creating a side hustle for those that want and just a web3 game for those that dont same as CSGO today but with Web3 now the skins can be used in Fortnite or call of duty,0,1,0,0,1

Its a fair assessment Just like any new concept there are bad actors for sure Its important for end users to educate themselves about the technology platforms and marketplaces before engaging in any transactions Many scams and fraudulent activities in the NFT and cryptocurrency space arise due to a lack of understanding among users but inherently blockchain technology which powers NFTs and cryptocurrencies offers decentralized and transparent systems This can combat issues like fraud cheating or unfair practices as the technology provides an immutable record of transactions and ownership It enables developers to create trustless systems ensuring that players assets and transactions are secure and verifiable,0,1,0,1,1
 to be clear Im not saying NFTs have scams or are frequently scams I am saying that they are fundamentally and always a scam You are investing in nothing and fundamentally the only way to make money off of nothing is by leeching off someone who made the same mistake you did Someone WILL be left holding the bag Same with crypto Maybe blockchain technology could be useful I dont know enough about it but regardless adding a speculative economy to digital items is predatory and wrong and thats inherent to NFTs and the concept for this game The fact that Myth has to sell you on the game not requiring engagement with the NFTlike aspect screams that it was probably a bad idea in the first place that shouldve been avoided,0,1,0,0,1
 In the context of shrapnel nfts will represent gear weapons and skins that you would otherwise just buy with credit card in any other free to play game and will just exist in your player account to be used in game The fact they are an nft is under the hood and wont affect your gaming experience Think if it as any other free to play shooter where you have the option to pay to get gear and perks in game,0,0,0,1,0
 am I getting replied to by bots? Are any of you actually reading what Im saying? The inclusion of NFTs optional or not is PREDATORY and WRONG for the reasons I already listed above,0,0,1,0,1

 Anyone can take a bad experience and start to generalize it easiest thing to do especially with new concept such as web3blockchainNFTs To be fair there are gaming studios who see NFTs as microtransactions 20 but they are doomed to fail because gamers can see through it You see it from the comments here lol Generalizing it as scampredatorywrong however is just plain ignorance imo Web2 companies who implement the tech properly eg striking the right balance of controlownership between them and users will prevail I look forward to that day USER ULTRA No Im not a bot lol You can bring better arguments than that,0,1,1,1,0
 lotto companies arent forcing anyone to spend money on them to gamble it doesnt mean that its any less predatory because its optional Fundamentally if you are engaging in the NFT aspect you are doing so to make money If you make money it means you profited off someone eventually being unable to sell what you sold when the game inevitably loses public interest The inherent concept of the NFT means scamming someone out of their money somewhere down the line Ill say it once again adding a speculative economy to digital items items that in fact dont contain any practical or standardized value is harmful All of this was already argued in my previous comments please just read what Im saying and respond to that instead of pretending I didnt say anything at all,0,1,0,0,1
 is it harmful to players who dont engage with the NFT aspect? No That doesnt make it ok though because the harmful aspect does exist and will do financial harm to folks like you who are into NFT trading to the benefit of the few of you who do make net gains,0,0,1,0,1

Yep fair point NFTs are just enhancements after all it enable players to truly own and authenticate ingame assets Previously players would invest time and money in acquiring rare items only to have them limited to a specific game or platform With NFTs players can securely own and trade these assets across multiple games or marketplaces providing a sense of true ownership but all these should be made optional,1,1,0,1,0

 I didnt mean to say that decentralisation is a bad idea In fact I like decentralisation especially like how mastodon does these things with ActivityPub Where Web3 falls short currently is the Crypto part in my opinion Naturally you are allowed to have a differing opinion but here is my standpoint on things When the Crypto bubble burst Web3 went with it simply because of its reliance on Crypto currencies in its current iteration I believe there is a future in decentralisation but not with the current flawed Crypto market I see the need for a decentralized currency but currently Crypto is corrupted with a boat load of scams It is a field of landmines where you could step upon a scam at any time All that being said I am open to having my mind changed I am already in agreement with you on the decentralisation part of web3 I guess just not the Crypto part,0,1,0,1,1

 If you still need a webserver to run your application you will still have scalibility issues What do you mean by onboarding FYI it isnt like I am shilling traditional web Because I would be more in favor of federation,0,1,0,1,0
 by scalability i mean decentralised servers are not as good as traditional ones Considering current major web2 apps And by onboarding i mean theres a big learning curve to get started with anything remotely web3 These two issues are keeping web3 to get the attention it needs right now Which will be resolved gradually,0,1,0,0,1
 I see that is a good point scalability I feel like similarly to federation that once the technology gets mature enough it could be solved Personally I think federation like mastodon is a better form of decentralisation The onboarding is far simpler less room for user error and still decentralized Not locked into a singular network Another thing that I am not sure about with web3 is the blockchain aspect I am not a fan of it Ofcourse you can be and that is completely okey I hope we can agree to disagree D So with my original comment I meant that it is a hype in the sense that there was a spike in popularity and that has massively died down imo I am not disagreeing that it could become a bigger thing in the future,0,1,0,1,1
Yup Lets say that everyone hosting server on AWS is the problem of centralization Then how is web3 supposed to help?

 inefficiencies involving monetary transactions You wont believe how massively inefficient web3 transactions are,0,1,1,0,0
 I believe that this inefficiency is mostly due to the relative young age of the technology in general when compared to the traditional framework of fiat finance that has decades of maturity behind it Once major blocking problems are resolved the security privacy and speed of these new systems will be much improved in the future We can witness this advancement in each new blockchain project that comes out they all try to innovate and add new features that the next wave of projects will get inspired from and then improve some more and so on We can see this in effect with the OG cryptos that are all bitcoinlike then comes a 2nd wave with ethereum and the many clones and slight variations that try to add their own value then a 3rd wave will come maybe with eth2 or something else entirely and who knows what well see by then,1,0,0,1,0
 Speed isnt really optimizable here Proof of work being done faster means the computations have to become more complex to prevent counterfeit making the speed increase nonexistent Im not even sure sharding avoids this with coins like Ethereum which are already energy intensive by design in a way that doesnt look avoidable The fact it began its life and continues to be a near entirely speculative market just makes it unworkable as currency replacement Even in principle the above weaknesses are necessary for them to function,0,1,0,0,1

 you say patience but this doesnt mean much People have invested trillions of hard earned dollars into this stuff Many of these people cant afford to gamble their money away and have done so on promises that its going to be revolutionary or have been told they just dont understand the complicated technology So maybe let me rephrase my question Which projects have you seen that give you confidence that this will in fact be revolutionary Surely you must have a few use cases in mind?,0,1,1,0,1
 yeah Im just shocked at how many people that work in this industry have been taken by the hype If you have disposable income and you find it fun to purchase NFTs then whatever When you begin to really believe decentralized currency is going to insert marketing slogan here and tell other people that they would be smart to throw all their savings into Bitcoin because its stable and obviously going to the moon we have a serious problem The lack of judgement is really unbelievable to me I wish I was exaggerating but most of the people I know that work in this field fit this description and have said stuff like this Many have families to support Its really frightening,0,1,1,0,1

 Well yeah CBDCs cant by definition exist on a decentralized network so this is a moot discussion But back to what they do offer is that on a two tier model it gives guys like the OP the option of a traditional less volatile medium of currency with the full backing of a central bank since thats their largest driver for adoption The future isnt eitheror To achieve global adoption transition and interoperability between an ecosystem is going to be a key component that makes or breaks crypto as the primary exchange of value for goods and services,0,1,0,1,0

USER Hearne thats what I mean with upscaling the tech is there for decentralized internet infrastructure the reason I mention Helium is that it represents an effort to provide incentive to maintain nodes for that If it was profitable people would absolutely invest in it If you could make money from running a node and maintaining connection to bunch of similar size nodes in the area which all fit within infrastructure on continental level the initial investment would be a decision worth considering,1,0,0,1,0

 They apparently decided not to but 10 months later I absolutely will because you said this in a rhetorical tone like it was some kind of absurd notion Yes central banks are a problem Yes the federal reserve is a problem Institutions having the ability to make up for bad policy and poor decision making by turning on the money printers and passing the cost down to the average person for 510 years in the form of inflation is a problem and removes the incentivization of said institutions and the government from thinking harder about these policies and decisions in the future Its the exact same reason why private companies are typically so much better than government at hitting goals within the time they initially estimate because they have a financial incentive to do so Its either their own revenue or shareholder money that theyre using and the latter will be quickly stripped away if you fail The government on the other hand has no shareholders it has taxpayers While one can argue that in theory these are similar in practice it has effectively nil accountability to use taxpayer money effectively What happens?

cvermillion On the topic of NFTs NFTs arent exclusively art as many makes it out to seem NFT is the token which is used to authenticate ownership creatorship and facilitate trades where as the image or file attached to it can pretty much be anything NFT art is mostly digital Someone cant really charge someone to own digital art since it can be copied which lead to the misunderstanding most people have about NFTs to begin with People make money through commissions but easily someone can repost it claim they own it and steal a significant amount of recognition NFT art is vastly different First off you can automatically declare you are the creator by being both first one to mint it and sign your own signature on it within the metadata This now means if theres any copy of that art piece that exists you can use an indexer query similar to google to automatically find who the original creator is Apps like twitter and discord are actually working this to create a verify ownership of an NFT so you cant just screenshot without proof Since they are on a shared decentralized ledger a blockchain not one company or entity owns it This means the security is a community driven effort so in the likelihood the anchor link you have to your file goes down that NFT will forever exist as long as theres one node on the network Right now most blockchains have MILLIONS NFT allows artists to get paid from royalties since you have a network that verifies and identify who the original owner is So if I sold my NFT to you but I brought it from website that original artist still gets paid No matter if its today or in 2099 That artist will forever get their cut Theres no thirdparty influence that can deem it otherwise,0,1,0,1,0
 thanks for the reply I know what an NFT is and how it works I just dont get where the web3 stands if NFTs can already be implemented with what we currently have In my opinion its a niche technology and you cant distribute all the systems in the name of privacy or security These things can be easily regulated by law if the government has interests to do so Edit take for example GDPR,0,1,0,0,1
cvermillion I thought my other comment was addedwhere I had explained web30 it but I guess not but for NFTs cant really be implemented in our current system because most of our systems are ran by Big Tech NFTs work better on a decentralized system for the reason the security and privacy is upheld by the community not a cooperation or government with an agenda,0,1,0,1,0
 I mentioned one before with the uber and NFT art for artist One example would be in video games In web2 if you want to share assets in the game those gaming IPs would have to do a partnership and integrate those assets directly With Web3 all of the data could be pulled from the same source So lets say you have a skin on a gun in COD Warzone that you want to play in Apex Legends If that skin was an NFT you can easily access it on both games This saves developers a ton of time and give companies new ways to monetize This is why big game companies like Ubisoft are taking part in this!,1,0,0,1,0
 I dont really see how this verification does anything Metadata is not an unalterable record The only thing you can do if someone steals your NFT especially in such a way that it strips metadata which is extremely easy eg basic programming functions or running it through any art program really is to say Hey I made that and the NFT provides credibility Theres no enforcement and there couldnt be outside of platformdependent rules But like my art being timestamped on DeviantArt does the same thing yes? A reverse image search on a stolen version of my art will bring up my DA first on Google and yea show it as having an older creation date than when the thief claimed it as their own Even your use case seems subject to the criticism that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem,0,1,0,0,1

Because this FAMAG now GAMMA because of Meta In Web3 GAMMA doesnt exist because everything is community driven You dont need to rely on a company for your entire application or data structure Its on the blockchain which is a shared ledger Web3 is all about decentralization and breaking up the monopolies digitally Instead of Uber taking 30 cut from their drivers a Decentralized Uber app creates a coin and all of the drivers keep 99 of the payment and the central system is managed by token holders and mods similar to discord and reddit They all get paid by the smart contract and governance system That is what web 3 is all about,1,0,0,1,0
 I understand the theory But who will pay the developers? If I had to choose between working at uber for money or working at decentralized uber just because i want to do something for the comunity I would have chosen money because I have got bills to pay Someone still has to work on updates marketing management product development and tons of other stuff and those people need to feed their families too,0,1,0,0,1
 Youd get paid directly from the project leaders Youd actually be able to get paid more because its in high demand and most of those profits would go back into your pocket The community funds the project If you look up Gitcoin thats an early concept on how that works So devs still get paid They get paid an absolute ton,1,0,0,1,0
 Who will be the project leaders if its not owned by anyone? Paid in what? Some random token?

I think the term Web 30 is HIGHLY misleading though the name stuck so I use it That implies its somehow a successor to 20 which it really isnt Its something entirely new and has its place but theres no way everything needs to be or would be done in decentralised infra In the best case scenario it would coexist with 20 and in worst case get buried in the ground Only the absolute most important piece of infra that is susceptible to power corruption and abuse like data handling or vote counting ??? should be done on this,0,1,0,1,0
IMO this web 3 should be regulated but it should not by goverments or any corporations we need some people we can give our trust to regulate this so we can no longer worries about our data for the time being but your opinion also the good one as long as this web 3 decentralized thing it needs some improvements to patch some holes,0,1,0,1,1
 Honestly having it regulated by ANYONE would directly link the stability of the entire system with that persons capability and behaviour Way too risky lets not do that,0,1,0,0,1
USER Hearne Thats not entirely true If Im remembering correctly it IS possible to regulate this space via DAOs decentralised automated organisation which basically is just code which is unambiguous everybody that knows code can understand it and you know it wont take bribery or do shady sht because the code does exactly what you ask it to do Its hard to change and you still have to trust the ones who implement it but IMO its a nicer solution because once implemented you know whats being implemented and theres not gonna be gotchas,0,1,0,1,0
 Its clear you dont get the joke Web 20 is very clearly marked by the observation that functionality is to be given by throwing a library at the problem The joke is that Web30 as of now is doing the same thing to handle interfacing with the blockchain It wasnt philosophical and its not sour grapes Its called a joke which you somehow needed to have explained,0,1,1,0,0
USER Hearne okay okay I hear you So the individual records become tokens on the blockchain? But then how does it work when theres different types of data? Like a todo list and bookings say?,0,0,0,1,0

Not really crypto is reliant on the Internet but not the Web Blockchain nodes do need things like IP addresses TCPUDP and cryptographic certificates to send messages to each other but they dont need DNS HTML web browsers social media etc Web3 is mostly concerned with rebuilding the latter people arent really changing the infrastructure pieces it depends on,0,1,0,1,0
 Imagine reverting to web 10 You cant really Will you be able to revert web 30 once it took hold? If not then the web has become dependent on blockchain and on crypto currencies,0,1,0,0,1

 Does it really matter that technically things could be done without the web?

 true but adopting the blockchain in this situation will cut off a lot of data entry processing jobs and help archiving documents which for business owners is really a pain in the ass Dont know what the law in USA enforces but where I live you have to keep every document receipt proof of ownership contract etc for at least 5 years There are businesses literally borrowing space in warehouses to store those documents in physical format then they hire other professional companies to destroy them for good Just imagine what the blockchain could do to that! ,0,1,0,0,1
 Just imagine how bloated and clogged the blockchain would become if everyone did that Then theres two solutions a 2nd layer that tries to avoid using the blockchain as much as possible Or a centralized blockchain  which is just the peak nonsense from a data storage perspective,0,1,0,0,1
Web 3 is happening now though with crypto NFTs and the metaverse Its just a matter of education and time for negative stigma to reduce To be honest Im not really sure many people have the proper knowledge of what Web3 actually is hence this negative view on it ITs similar to how many people hated the internet because they didnt really understand how it works I give examples like no longer needing an EmailPassword for authentication but thats scratching the surface,1,1,0,1,0

 Bro wtf are you saying ?

 The smart contract blockchain only works to record the points the characters and the items not the movements For the cheaters think like a social network you need to report an user to the social network bans him So the user who saw the cheater needs to send a report to the network blockchain saying heshe is a cheater If the cheater user gets a lot of complaints so heshe is banned from the contract Heshe will need to pay another transaction to the smart contract to play the game again with another nickname,0,0,1,0,1

 Who tracks the actions of the players is the platform game in the client browser or PC The blockchain is just a database to save the data not the game engine To set up an account on a game you need to pay a transaction If your wallet address is banned you cant use it to create another account on the game You would need to create another wallet address that is not connected to the old one this new wallet never received a coin from the old wallet this means you need to receive money from someone else in another new wallet address To the attacker abuse the game heshe needs a lot of resources to create new wallet accounts and a lot of ways to receive money that is not connected with banned wallet address Example If I search on the blockchain and I discover that the 0xabc banned account received money from the 0x123 new account so I block both accounts,0,1,0,0,1

these flaws have been perpetuated for years since day 1 actually with the promise that one day things will be better the only thing which has happened is that hacks have increased in number and value the code governing these systems is rubish in most part thats because you dont need a blockchain to solve all issues the Layer 1 of blockchain should be simple robust and secure many crypto bros like to point out how many developers are working on etherium but the reality is most are working on html and some ux and things like this they are not proper smart and exoerienced engineers,0,1,1,0,0
 Youre right I almost completely agree with you Most of crypto is rubbish and the industry really needs to focus on UIUX as well as security When you say that the number of hacks has increased in numbers and value isnt that quite obvious when the market size has increased more than almost any industry percentage wise? It doesnt justify the poor security standards many sloppy actors in the space have and some regulation is certainly needed my point mostly was that most of his arguments are irrelevant,0,1,1,0,1

HI thanks for the excellent question here is the answer PeopleOrganisationsCollectives can add their arts and content as NFT without any approval from any centralized organization and they have the complete control over the whole cycle of their content for example exhibition or auction of their content will be totally under their control also whatever they gain or lose out of that they will be not obligated to any other sector or organization all this due to decentralization And due to this anyone can enjoy the perks of NFTs irrelevant of any sort of criteria imposed by any sort of organization Why not subscribe to our channel to keep up to date with the latest tech trends explained in beginner friendly videos Cheers! ,1,0,0,1,0
 I do have one concern unless I am missing something You mention auction In other words I could sell something with literally unequivocally total control Kind of like WhatsApp end to end encryption to loosely describe it Essentially only I and the other partyies that are communicating know what the exchanges transactions conversations whatever it is were doing are about and no need for BIG BROTHERs approval figuratively speaking? Is there another link you can provide me to further explain this process? Is Blockchain similar to the cloud?

I believe that this video aims to educate people about web3 while also trying to raise fear so that people dont use it Blockchain and decentralization promote innovation because they limit government control preventing them from imposing taxes The absence of taxes can lead to more freedom fostering greater innovation,1,1,0,0,1
 Decentralization and distributed systems are great for democratization but in so doing they also remove a lot of the financial incentives that currently drive innovation and competition Now thats not necessarily a bad thing but its not clear what would drive new innovation without the existing captialistic market pressures created by centralized markets,1,1,0,0,1
Totally agree Since the beginning I didnt believe in NFT as business,0,1,0,0,0

Just not too eh stable Here are a few examples that are a no go If copyright an NFT has no ownership other than on the blockchain The piece could easily be copied and sold No metadata to say otherwise If currency even for stable tokenscoins You are buying into a stock as a currency A stock which rises and falls Which crashes worse than basic currency So 5k today but maybe its 10 tomorrow The user base not all but most 90 This lump some are scamming more people with these technologies Even ownersCEOs of these techs are stealing from each other left and right It really doesnt paint a bright future for decentralizedtoken based future of the web,0,1,1,0,1

sincd enslavement and genocide hasnt completely banned huge populations from participating in it for millennia and multiple generations like the oil and gassteel even sugar industries That means more regular people have a chance and have already became millionaires or have started accumulating wealthits a much level playing field when literally anyone with a smartphone and 10 can educate themselves and turn that 10into 1000 in a matter of months just by learning about the same platform your already invested in You own apart of the network instead of owning shares of a company that already exist on a particular network Its literally taking every aspect of the digital world large corporations and tech companies make money off of and allowing Anyone to do the exact same thing NO different than a gamer buying coins in a game to purchase special items Difference is instead of the corporation owning all the coins they traded for dollars you own a piece of the actual market by holding coins that otherwise the gaming company would own So ins contrast to giving Call Of Duty money for game coins to buy a specific gun you earn profits when people purchase items from a game on that specific platform Essentially being a consumer of the coin makes you part owner of the platform that others buy into to make purchases in the games offered by that platform Which at the moment seems to be called the metaverse Besides if the ones who own the most are making the dcisions that the ones that own less dont like instead of using government to create legislation to change the way that market operates you and everyone else can short the market then bail then reinvest in a market that operates to your preference DAOs are the best available option to put the public in direct ownership of industries So instead of those industries operating off legislation and lobbyist money they are functioning off actual public sentiment and trend It brings us closer to a reality where Majority rules more directly instead of through elected officials and laws In my personal opinion people who say they want equality and financial freedom for all and sovereignty that are against it have simply been manipukated into fearing it by the Media and Ignorance You cant be against Centralized Power and Blockchain Tech or DeFi unless you prefer returning to bartering goods and services and precious metals as the standard tender of exchange With the population explosion since Nixon took us off the Gold Standard returning to it only means over 4billion more people fighting for the same gold as only 50 years ago Horrible Idea,1,1,0,1,0

I was thinking about this too back when downloading music for free was cool you had BitTorrent lime wire pirate bay etc all were decentralized and your were anonymous Information wasnt censored and you you were encouraged to support the network and were often rewarded for providing your computer as a node by giving you faster download speeds of content all this was totally free I feel like Crypto is a solution looking for a problem to latch onto I dont think currency apps or Web 30 is the final home for block chain There are some interesting applications for public ledgers that are 3rd party audited for logging property ownership but nobody is talking about that because there is no money there and the current system works well enough,0,1,0,1,0

I though there is a thing called Web3 which wants to change ToSs and in that way renegotiate how services on the internet work Like going through a checklist what what data you agree and dont agree to share in almost individual increments and that will dynamically adapt the service you are getting For example maybe if you are unwilling to share location data you wont be able to get local advertising and instead will be served global advertising Or of you dont want to share likes then the algorithm will not recommend you stuff based on what you like This will make it so products and services cant collect data secretly in theory anyway and you are in charge of it but it will still be centralized which I personally dont see a problem with Its like agreeing to section 5 and 8 of the terms of service but 6 and 7 which currently would invalidate you completely from the product or service While in Web3 you will get part of the product or service depending on the exact agreements you have So maybe in Facebook you wont get the ability to join groups but you will still see posts by friends etc etc,1,0,0,1,0
 So what you describe would be awesome for sure But your description is more or less the current web with the big tech companies deciding to do business differently Thats seems unlikely From what Ive come across people using the term Web3 are referring to services and apps that are delivered on a blockchain without a centralize companyserver in control of anything Thats pretty powerful because as users decide I want that the creators cant go back and change what the service does like what Facebook did with WhatsApp As said in the video the Web3 or Web 30 is an idea and it doesnt exist yet Or more properly it exist but not everyone is using it yet It reminds me of when mainstream media started using the term Web 20 like look out here comes the Web 20! but the idea and functionality was already well underway There will not be a blockchain based Facebook but there will be a widely adopted social network on a blockchain where anonymous but confirmed identities exist and nobody can be censored or kicked off How will that work?
